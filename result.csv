Animals	Tiger	The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own. The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in Western and Central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. Today's tiger range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra.  The tiger is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the populations living in small pockets isolated from each other. India currently hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict, in particular in range countries with a high human population density. The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It featured prominently in ancient mythology and folklore and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams. The tiger is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.	the tiger panthera tigris is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus panthera it is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange brown fur with a lighter underside it is an apex predator primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar it is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator requiring large contiguous areas of habitat which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years before they become independent and leave their mother s home range to establish their own the tiger once ranged widely from the eastern anatolia region in the west to the amur river basin and in the south from the foothills of the himalayas to bali in the sunda islands since the early century tiger populations have lost at least of their historic range and have been extirpated in western and central asia from the islands of java and bali and in large areas of southeast and south asia and china today s tiger range is fragmented stretching from siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the indian subcontinent and sumatra the tiger is listed as endangered on the iucn red list as of the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between and mature individuals with most of the populations living in small pockets isolated from each other india currently hosts the largest tiger population major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction habitat fragmentation and poaching tigers are also victims of human wildlife conflict in particular in range countries with a high human population density the tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world s charismatic megafauna it featured prominently in ancient mythology and folklore and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature appearing on many flags coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams the tiger is the national animal of india bangladesh malaysia and south korea
Animals	Rabbit	Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae (along with the hare) of the order Lagomorpha (along with the pika).  Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds[1] of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet. With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit (or bunny) is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration. Although once considered rodents, lagomorphs like rabbits have been discovered to have diverged separately and earlier than their rodent cousins, and have a number of traits rodents lack, like two extra incisors.	rabbits are small mammals in the family leporidae along with the hare of the order lagomorpha along with the pika oryctolagus cuniculus includes the european rabbit species and its descendants the world s breeds of domestic rabbit sylvilagus includes wild rabbit species among them the seven types of cottontail the european rabbit which has been introduced on every continent except antarctica is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet with its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures the rabbit or bunny is in many areas of the world a part of daily life as food clothing a companion and a source of artistic inspiration although once considered rodents lagomorphs like rabbits have been discovered to have diverged separately and earlier than their rodent cousins and have a number of traits rodents lack like two extra incisors
Animals	Koala Bear	The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear[a]  (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which are members of the family Vombatidae. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed. Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus. Koalas were hunted by Indigenous Australians and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed scientific description of the koala in 1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist John Gould illustrated and described the koala, introducing the species to the general British public. Further details about the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists. Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide as a symbol of Australia. Koalas are listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The animal was hunted heavily in the early 20th century for its fur, and large-scale cullings in Queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species. Sanctuaries were established, and translocation efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced. Among the many threats to their existence are habitat destruction caused by agriculture, urbanisation, droughts and associated bushfires, some related to climate change.	the koala or inaccurately koala bear a phascolarctos cinereus is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to australia it is the only extant representative of the family phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats which are members of the family vombatidae the koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland s eastern and southern regions inhabiting queensland new south wales victoria and south australia it is easily recognisable by its stout tailless body and large head with round fluffy ears and large spoon shaped nose the koala has a body length of cm in and weighs kg lb fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south these populations possibly are separate subspecies but this is disputed koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to hours a day they are asocial animals and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests being marsupials koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers pouches where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives these young koalas known as joeys are fully weaned around a year old koalas have few natural predators and parasites but are threatened by various pathogens such as chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus koalas were hunted by indigenous australians and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia the first recorded encounter between a european and a koala was in and an image of the animal was published in by naturalist george perry botanist robert brown wrote the first detailed scientific description of the koala in although his work remained unpublished for years popular artist john gould illustrated and described the koala introducing the species to the general british public further details about the animal s biology were revealed in the century by several english scientists because of its distinctive appearance the koala is recognised worldwide as a symbol of australia koalas are listed as a vulnerable species by the international union for conservation of nature the animal was hunted heavily in the early century for its fur and large scale cullings in queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species sanctuaries were established and translocation efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced among the many threats to their existence are habitat destruction caused by agriculture urbanisation droughts and associated bushfires some related to climate change
Animals	Guinea Pig	The  guinea pig or domestic guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), also known as cavy or domestic cavy (/ˈkeɪvi/), is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia. Despite their common name, guinea pigs are not native to Guinea, nor are they closely biologically related to pigs, and the origin of the name is still unclear. They originated in the Andes of South America. Studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy, such as C. tschudii, and do not exist naturally in the wild.[1][2] They were originally domesticated as livestock, for a source of meat, and continue to be consumed as food. In Western society, the domestic guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a pocket pet, since its introduction to Europe and North America by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature, friendly responsiveness to handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring for them have made guinea pigs a continuing popular choice of household pet. Organizations devoted to the competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide. Many specialized breeds, with varying coat colors and textures, are selected by breeders. The domestic guinea pig plays an important role in folk culture for many indigenous Andean peoples, especially as a food source. It is also used in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies.[3] The animals are used for meat and are a culinary staple in the Andes Mountains, where they are known as cuy.  In the 1960s a modern breeding program was started in Peru that resulted in large breeds known as cuy mejorados (improved cuy). Marketers tried to increase consumption of the animal outside South America.[4] Biological experimentation on domestic guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were used so frequently as model organisms in the 19th and 20th centuries that the epithet guinea pig came into use to describe a human test subject. Since that time, they have been largely replaced by other rodents, such as mice and rats. However, they are still used in research, primarily as models to study such human medical conditions as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy (like humans, they require dietary intake of vitamin C), and pregnancy complications.	the guinea pig or domestic guinea pig cavia porcellus also known as cavy or domestic cavy ˈkeɪvi is a species of rodent belonging to the family caviidae and the genus cavia despite their common name guinea pigs are not native to guinea nor are they closely biologically related to pigs and the origin of the name is still unclear they originated in the andes of south america studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as c tschudii and do not exist naturally in the wild they were originally domesticated as livestock for a source of meat and continue to be consumed as food in western society the domestic guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a pocket pet since its introduction to europe and north america by european traders in the century their docile nature friendly responsiveness to handling and feeding and the relative ease of caring for them have made guinea pigs a continuing popular choice of household pet organizations devoted to the competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide many specialized breeds with varying coat colors and textures are selected by breeders the domestic guinea pig plays an important role in folk culture for many indigenous andean peoples especially as a food source it is also used in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies the animals are used for meat and are a culinary staple in the andes mountains where they are known as cuy in the a modern breeding program was started in peru that resulted in large breeds known as cuy mejorados improved cuy marketers tried to increase consumption of the animal outside south america biological experimentation on domestic guinea pigs has been carried out since the century the animals were used so frequently as model organisms in the and centuries that the epithet guinea pig came into use to describe a human test subject since that time they have been largely replaced by other rodents such as mice and rats however they are still used in research primarily as models to study such human medical conditions as juvenile diabetes tuberculosis scurvy like humans they require dietary intake of vitamin c and pregnancy complications
Animals	Mouse	A mouse, plural mice, is a small rodent. Characteristically, mice are known to have a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail, and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (Mus musculus). Mice are also popular as pets. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter. Mice are classified under the order Rodentia. Typical mice are classified in the genus Mus. Mice are typically distinguished from rats by their size. Generally, when someone discovers a smaller muroid rodent, its common name includes the term mouse. If it is larger, the name includes the term rat. The common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically specific. Scientifically, the term mouse is not confined to members of Mus for example, but also applies to species from other genera such as the deer mouse, Peromyscus. Domestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse. This is attributable to breeding and different conditions in the wild. The best-known strain of mouse is the white lab mouse. It has more uniform traits that are appropriate to its use in research. Cats, wild dogs, foxes, birds of prey, snakes and even certain kinds of arthropods have been known to prey heavily upon mice. Despite this, mice populations remain plentiful. Due to its remarkable adaptability to almost any environment, the mouse is one of the most successful mammalian genera living on Earth today. In certain contexts, mice can be considered vermin. Vermin are a major source of crop damage,[1] as they are known to cause structural damage and spread disease. Mice spread disease through their feces and are often carriers of parasites.[2] In North America, breathing dust that has come in contact with mouse excrement has been linked to hantavirus, which may lead to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Primarily nocturnal[3] animals, mice compensate for their poor eyesight with a keen sense of hearing. They depend on their sense of smell to locate food and avoid predators.[4] In the wild, mice are known to build intricate burrows. These burrows have long entrances and are equipped with escape tunnels. In at least one species, the architectural design of a burrow is a genetic trait.[5]	a mouse plural mice is a small rodent characteristically mice are known to have a pointed snout small rounded ears a body length scaly tail and a high breeding rate the best known mouse species is the common house mouse mus musculus mice are also popular as pets in some places certain kinds of field mice are locally common they are known to invade homes for food and shelter mice are classified under the order rodentia typical mice are classified in the genus mus mice are typically distinguished from rats by their size generally when someone discovers a smaller muroid rodent its common name includes the term mouse if it is larger the name includes the term rat the common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically specific scientifically the term mouse is not confined to members of mus for example but also applies to species from other genera such as the deer mouse peromyscus domestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse this is attributable to breeding and different conditions in the wild the best known strain of mouse is the white lab mouse it has more uniform traits that are appropriate to its use in research cats wild dogs foxes birds of prey snakes and even certain kinds of arthropods have been known to prey heavily upon mice despite this mice populations remain plentiful due to its remarkable adaptability to almost any environment the mouse is one of the most successful mammalian genera living on earth today in certain contexts mice can be considered vermin vermin are a major source of crop damage as they are known to cause structural damage and spread disease mice spread disease through their feces and are often carriers of parasites in north america breathing dust that has come in contact with mouse excrement has been linked to hantavirus which may lead to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps primarily nocturnal animals mice compensate for their poor eyesight with a keen sense of hearing they depend on their sense of smell to locate food and avoid predators in the wild mice are known to build intricate burrows these burrows have long entrances and are equipped with escape tunnels in at least one species the architectural design of a burrow is a genetic trait
Animals	Penguin	Penguins (order Sphenisciformes /sfɪˈnɪsɪfɔːrmiːz/, family Spheniscidae /sfɪˈnɪsɪdiː/) are a group of aquatic flightless birds.  They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galápagos penguin, found north of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while swimming underwater. They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the temperate zone, but one species, the Galápagos penguin, lives near the Equator. The largest living species is the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri):[1] on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb).  The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 33 cm (13 in) tall and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb).[2] Among extant penguins, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates. Some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human. These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region around 2,000 km south of the Equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than today.[which?]	penguins order sphenisciformes sfɪˈnɪsɪfɔːrmiːz family spheniscidae sfɪˈnɪsɪdiː are a group of aquatic flightless birds they live almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere with only one species the galápagos penguin found north of the equator highly adapted for life in the water penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming most penguins feed on krill fish squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while swimming underwater they spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea although almost all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere they are not found only in cold climates such as antarctica in fact only a few species of penguin live so far south several species are found in the temperate zone but one species the galápagos penguin lives near the equator the largest living species is the emperor penguin aptenodytes forsteri on average adults are about m ft in tall and weigh kg lb the smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin eudyptula minor also known as the fairy penguin which stands around cm in tall and weighs kg lb among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human these were not restricted to antarctic regions on the contrary subantarctic regions harboured high diversity and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region around km south of the equator mya in a climate decidedly warmer than today which
Animals	Cat	The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6] The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk, the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] It secretes and perceives pheromones.[8] Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species, and evoking population control.[10] Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC.[11] It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in ancient Egypt, as since around 3100 BC veneration was given to cats in ancient Egypt.[12][13] As of 2017[update], the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned.[14][15][16] In the United Kingdom, around 7.3 million cats lived in more than 4.8 million households as of 2019[update].[17]	the cat felis catus is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal it is the only domesticated species in the family felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family a cat can either be a house cat a farm cat or a feral cat the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents about cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries the cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species it has a strong flexible body quick reflexes sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey its night vision and sense of smell are well developed cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing purring trilling hissing growling and grunting as well as cat specific body language a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species it can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears such as those made by mice and other small mammals it secretes and perceives pheromones female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats a hobby known as cat fancy failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering as well as abandonment of pets resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide contributing to the extinction of entire bird mammal and reptile species and evoking population control cats were first domesticated in the near east around bc it was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in ancient egypt as since around bc veneration was given to cats in ancient egypt as of update the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the united states with million cats owned in the united kingdom around million cats lived in more than million households as of update
Animals	Dog	"The dog (Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf)[5] is a domesticated carnivore of the family Canidae. It is part of the wolf-like canids,[6] and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.[7][8][9][10][11] The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,[12][13][14] which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.[15] The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[14][16] and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[17] Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior,[18] and they can thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[19] Dogs vary widely in shape, size, and colors.[20] They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding disabled people, and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of ""man's best friend."""	the dog canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf is a domesticated carnivore of the family canidae it is part of the wolf like canids and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore the dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct the dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors sensory capabilities and physical attributes their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they can thrive on a starch rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids dogs vary widely in shape size and colors they perform many roles for humans such as hunting herding pulling loads protection assisting police and military companionship and more recently aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles this influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of man s best friend
Animals	Lion	The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane. With a typical head-to-body length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72 in). It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not. Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged from Central Asia, Southeast Europe to Africa, but today it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one critically endangered population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern. One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's former and current ranges.	the lion panthera leo is a species in the family felidae and a member of the genus panthera it has a muscular deep chested body short rounded head round ears and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail it is sexually dimorphic adult male lions have a prominent mane with a typical head to body length of cm in they are larger than females at cm in it is a social species forming groups called prides a lion pride consists of a few adult males related females and cubs groups of female lions usually hunt together preying mostly on large ungulates the lion is an apex and keystone predator although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans the species typically does not typically the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas but is absent in dense forests it is usually more diurnal than other big cats but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at twilight during the neolithic period the lion ranged from central asia southeast europe to africa but today it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub saharan africa and one critically endangered population in western india it has been listed as vulnerable on the iucn red list since because populations in african countries have declined by about since the early lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas although the cause of the decline is not fully understood habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings on national flags and in contemporary films and literature lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the roman empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late century cultural depictions of lions were prominent in ancient egypt and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion s former and current ranges
Animals	Fox	"Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. Foxes have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush). Twelve species belong to the monophyletic ""true foxes"" group of genus Vulpes. Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.[1] Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. By far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.[2] The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World."	foxes are small to medium sized omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family canidae foxes have a flattened skull upright triangular ears a pointed slightly upturned snout and a long bushy tail or brush twelve species belong to the monophyletic true foxes group of genus vulpes approximately another current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the south american foxes or of the outlying group which consists of the bat eared fox gray fox and island fox foxes live on every continent except antarctica by far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox vulpes vulpes with about recognized subspecies the global distribution of foxes together with their widespread reputation for cunning has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world the hunting of foxes with packs of hounds long an established pursuit in europe especially in the british isles was exported by european settlers to various parts of the new world
Animals	Horse	"The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior. Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, possessing an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults.[4] Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years. Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited ""hot bloods"" with speed and endurance; ""cold bloods"", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and ""warmbloods"", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses. Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water, and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers."	the horse equus ferus caballus is one of two extant subspecies of equus ferus it is an odd toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family equidae the horse has evolved over the past to million years from a small multi toed creature eohippus into the large single toed animal of today humans began domesticating horses around bc and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by bc horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses these feral populations are not true wild horses as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated such as the endangered przewalski s horse a separate subspecies and the only remaining true wild horse there is an extensive specialized vocabulary used to describe equine related concepts covering everything from anatomy to life stages size colors markings breeds locomotion and behavior horses are adapted to run allowing them to quickly escape predators possessing an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight or flight response related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults female horses called mares carry their young for approximately months and a young horse called a foal can stand and run shortly following birth most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four they reach full adult development by age five and have an average lifespan of between and years horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament spirited hot bloods with speed and endurance cold bloods such as draft horses and some ponies suitable for slow heavy work and warmbloods developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes particularly in europe there are more than breeds of horse in the world today developed for many different uses horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non competitive recreational pursuits as well as in working activities such as police work agriculture entertainment and therapy horses were historically used in warfare from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed using many different styles of equipment and methods of control many products are derived from horses including meat milk hide hair bone and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares humans provide domesticated horses with food water and shelter as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers
Animals	Zebra	Zebras[a] (subgenus Hippotigris) are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three extant species: the Grévy's zebra (Equus grevyi), plains zebra (E. quagga) and the mountain zebra (E. zebra). Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses, the three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae. Zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these stripes, with most evidence supporting them as a form of protection from biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and southern Africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, shrublands and mountainous areas. Zebras are primarily grazers and can subsist on lower-quality vegetation. They are preyed on mainly by lions and typically flee when threatened but also bite and kick. Zebra species differ in social behaviour, with plains and mountain zebra living in stable harems consisting of an adult male or stallion, several adult females or mares, and their young or foals; while Grévy's zebra live alone or in loosely associated herds. In harem-holding species, adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while male Grévy's zebras establish territories which attract females and the species is promiscuous. Zebras communicate with various vocalisations, body postures and facial expressions. Social grooming strengthens social bonds in plains and mountain zebras. A zebra's dazzling stripes make them among the most recognisable mammals. They have been featured in art and stories in Africa and beyond. Historically, they have been highly sought after by exotic animal collectors, but unlike horses and donkeys, zebras have never been truly domesticated. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the Grévy's zebra as endangered, the mountain zebra as vulnerable and the plains zebra as near-threatened. The quagga, a type of plains zebra, was driven to extinction in the 19th century. Nevertheless, zebras can be found in numerous protected areas.	zebras a subgenus hippotigris are african equines with distinctive black and white striped coats there are three extant species the grévy s zebra equus grevyi plains zebra e quagga and the mountain zebra e zebra zebras share the genus equus with horses and asses the three groups being the only living members of the family equidae zebra stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual several theories have been proposed for the function of these stripes with most evidence supporting them as a form of protection from biting flies zebras inhabit eastern and southern africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs grasslands woodlands shrublands and mountainous areas zebras are primarily grazers and can subsist on lower quality vegetation they are preyed on mainly by lions and typically flee when threatened but also bite and kick zebra species differ in social behaviour with plains and mountain zebra living in stable harems consisting of an adult male or stallion several adult females or mares and their young or foals while grévy s zebra live alone or in loosely associated herds in harem holding species adult females mate only with their harem stallion while male grévy s zebras establish territories which attract females and the species is promiscuous zebras communicate with various vocalisations body postures and facial expressions social grooming strengthens social bonds in plains and mountain zebras a zebra s dazzling stripes make them among the most recognisable mammals they have been featured in art and stories in africa and beyond historically they have been highly sought after by exotic animal collectors but unlike horses and donkeys zebras have never been truly domesticated the international union for conservation of nature iucn lists the grévy s zebra as endangered the mountain zebra as vulnerable and the plains zebra as near threatened the quagga a type of plains zebra was driven to extinction in the century nevertheless zebras can be found in numerous protected areas
Animals	Donkey	"The donkey or ass (Equus africanus asinus)[1][2] is a domesticated member of the horse family, Equidae. The wild ancestor of the donkey is the African wild ass, E. africanus. The donkey has been used as a working animal for at least 5000 years. There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in underdeveloped countries, where they are used principally as draught or pack animals. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels. Small numbers of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries. A male donkey or ass is called a jack, a female a jenny or jennet;[3][4][5] a young donkey is a foal.[5] Jack donkeys are often used to mate with female horses to produce mules; the biological ""reciprocal"" of a mule, from a stallion and jenny as its parents instead, is called a hinny. Asses were first domesticated around 3000 BC, probably in Egypt or Mesopotamia,[6][7]  and have spread around the world. They continue to fill important roles in many places today.  While domesticated species are increasing in numbers,  the African wild ass is a critically endangered species. As beasts of burden and companions, asses and donkeys have worked together with humans for millennia."	the donkey or ass equus africanus asinus is a domesticated member of the horse family equidae the wild ancestor of the donkey is the african wild ass e africanus the donkey has been used as a working animal for at least years there are more than million donkeys in the world mostly in underdeveloped countries where they are used principally as draught or pack animals working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels small numbers of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries a male donkey or ass is called a jack a female a jenny or jennet a young donkey is a foal jack donkeys are often used to mate with female horses to produce mules the biological reciprocal of a mule from a stallion and jenny as its parents instead is called a hinny asses were first domesticated around bc probably in egypt or mesopotamia and have spread around the world they continue to fill important roles in many places today while domesticated species are increasing in numbers the african wild ass is a critically endangered species as beasts of burden and companions asses and donkeys have worked together with humans for millennia
Animals	Giraffe	"The giraffe (Giraffa) is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant.  It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. However, the existence of up to eight extant giraffe species has been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils. The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. Giraffes may be preyed on by lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through ""necking"", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young. The giraffe has intrigued various cultures, both ancient and modern, for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as vulnerable to extinction, and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves but estimates as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010."	the giraffe giraffa is an african artiodactyl mammal the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant it is traditionally considered to be one species giraffa camelopardalis with nine subspecies however the existence of up to eight extant giraffe species has been described based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear dna as well as morphological measurements of giraffa seven other species are extinct prehistoric species known from fossils the giraffe s chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs its horn like ossicones and its distinctive coat patterns it is classified under the family giraffidae along with its closest extant relative the okapi its scattered range extends from chad in the north to south africa in the south and from niger in the west to somalia in the east giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands their food source is leaves fruits and flowers of woody plants primarily acacia species which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach giraffes may be preyed on by lions leopards spotted hyenas and african wild dogs giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations males establish social hierarchies through necking which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon dominant males gain mating access to females which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young the giraffe has intrigued various cultures both ancient and modern for its peculiar appearance and has often been featured in paintings books and cartoons it is classified by the international union for conservation of nature as vulnerable to extinction and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves but estimates as of indicate that there are approximately members of giraffa in the wild more than were kept in zoos in
Animals	Panda	"The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo),[5] also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear[6] native to south central China.[1] It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name ""giant panda"" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.[7] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.[8][9] The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.[10] As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.[11][12] A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country.[13] As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different countries.[14] Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild,[13] while a 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000.[15] Some reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise.[16] In March 2015, conservation news site Mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864.[17] In 2016, the IUCN reclassified the species from ""endangered"" to ""vulnerable"",[12] affirming decade-long efforts to save the panda. While the dragon has often served as China's national symbol, internationally the giant panda has often filled this role. As such, it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts, for example, appearing since 1982 on gold panda bullion coins and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics."	the giant panda ailuropoda melanoleuca chinese 大熊猫 pinyin dàxióngmāo also known as the panda bear or simply the panda is a bear native to south central china it is characterised by large black patches around its eyes over the ears and across its round body the name giant panda is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda a neighboring musteloid though it belongs to the order carnivora the giant panda is a folivore with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than of its diet giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses wild tubers or even meat in the form of birds rodents or carrion in captivity they may receive honey eggs fish yams shrub leaves oranges or bananas along with specially prepared food the giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central china mainly in sichuan but also in neighbouring shaanxi and gansu as a result of farming deforestation and other development the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived and it is a conservation reliant vulnerable species a report showed pandas living in captivity inside china and another outside the country as of december giant pandas lived in captivity outside china living in zoos in different countries wild population estimates vary one estimate shows that there are about individuals living in the wild while a study via dna analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as to some reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise in march conservation news site mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had increased by or to in the iucn reclassified the species from endangered to vulnerable affirming decade long efforts to save the panda while the dragon has often served as china s national symbol internationally the giant panda has often filled this role as such it is becoming widely used within china in international contexts for example appearing since on gold panda bullion coins and as one of the five fuwa mascots of the beijing olympics
Sports	Football	Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.  Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football.[1][2] These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes. There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.[3][4][5] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.[6][7] The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[8]  By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[9]  In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[10]	football is a family of team sports that involve to varying degrees kicking a ball to score a goal unqualified the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used sports commonly called football include association football known as soccer in some countries gridiron football specifically american football or canadian football australian rules football rugby football either rugby union or rugby league and gaelic football these various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes there are a number of references to traditional ancient or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at english public schools during the century the expansion and cultural influence of the british empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of british influence outside the directly controlled empire by the end of the century distinct regional codes were already developing gaelic football for example deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage in the football league was founded in england becoming the first of many professional football competitions during the century several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world
Sports	Badminton	"Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are ""singles"" (with one player per side) and ""doubles"" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court. Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.[1] The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature. The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles,[2] with mixed doubles added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.[3]"	badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net although it may be played with larger teams the most common forms of the game are singles with one player per side and doubles with two players per side badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side s half of the court each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire service judge or in their absence the opposing side the shuttlecock is a feathered or in informal matches plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports in particular the feathers create much higher drag causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports the flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature the game developed in british india from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock european play came to be dominated by denmark but the game has become very popular in asia with recent competitions dominated by china since badminton has been a summer olympic sport with four events men s singles women s singles men s doubles and women s doubles with mixed doubles added four years later at high levels of play the sport demands excellent fitness players require aerobic stamina agility strength speed and precision it is also a technical sport requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements
Sports	Field Hockey	"Field hockey is a widely played team sport of the hockey family. The game can be played on grass, watered turf, artificial turf or synthetic field, as well as an indoor boarded surface. Each team plays with ten field players and a goalkeeper. Players use sticks made of wood, carbon fibre, fibre glass, or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities, to hit a round, hard, plastic hockey ball. The length of the hockey stick is based on the player's individual height: the top of the stick usually comes to the players hip, and taller players typically have longer sticks.[1] The sticks have a round side and a flat side, and only the flat face of the stick is allowed to be used. Use of the other side results in a foul. Goalies often have a different design of stick, although they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick. The specific goal-keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick, which is to give it more surface area to block the ball. The uniform consists of shin guards, shoes, shorts or a skirt, a mouthguard and a jersey. The game is played globally, particularly in parts of Western Europe, South Asia, Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and parts of the United States, primarily New England and the Mid-Atlantic states.[2][3] Known simply as ""hockey"" in most territories, the term ""field hockey"" is used primarily in Canada and the United States where ice hockey is more popular. In Sweden, the term landhockey is used, and to some degree in Norway, where the game is governed by the Norges Bandyforbund.[4] During play, goal keepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with any part of their body, while field players can only play the ball with the flat side of their stick. A player's hand is considered part of the stick if holding the stick. If the ball is touched with the rounded part of the stick, it will result in a penalty. Goal keepers also cannot play the ball with the back of their stick. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time, or there is a penalty shoot-out, depending on the format of the competition. There are many variations to overtime play that depend on the league or tournament rules. In American college play, a seven-aside overtime period consists of a 10-minute golden goal period with seven players for each team. If a tie still remains, the game enters a one-on-one competition where each team chooses five players to dribble from the 25-yard (23 m) line down to the circle against the opposing goalie. The player has eight seconds to score against the goalie while keeping the ball in bounds. The game ends after a goal is scored, the ball goes out of bounds, a foul is committed (ending in either a penalty stroke or flick or the end of the one-on-one) or time expires. If the tie still persists, more rounds are played until one team has scored. The governing body of field hockey is the International Hockey Federation (FIH), called the Fédération Internationale de Hockey in French, with men and women being represented internationally in competitions including the Olympic Games, World Cup, World League, Champions Trophy and Junior World Cup, with many countries running extensive junior, senior, and masters club competitions. The FIH is also responsible for organizing the Hockey Rules Board and developing the rules of the game. A popular variant of field hockey is indoor field hockey, which differs in a number of respects while embodying the primary principles of hockey. Indoor hockey is a 5-a-side variant, using a field which is reduced to approximately 40 m × 20 m (131 ft × 66 ft). Although many of the rules remain the same, including obstruction and feet, there are several key variations: players may not raise the ball unless shooting at goal, players may not hit the ball, instead using pushes to transfer it, and the sidelines are replaced with solid barriers, from which the ball will rebound and remain in play.[5] In addition, the regulation guidelines for the indoor field hockey stick require a slightly thinner, lighter stick than an outdoor one.[6]"	field hockey is a widely played team sport of the hockey family the game can be played on grass watered turf artificial turf or synthetic field as well as an indoor boarded surface each team plays with ten field players and a goalkeeper players use sticks made of wood carbon fibre fibre glass or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities to hit a round hard plastic hockey ball the length of the hockey stick is based on the player s individual height the top of the stick usually comes to the players hip and taller players typically have longer sticks the sticks have a round side and a flat side and only the flat face of the stick is allowed to be used use of the other side results in a foul goalies often have a different design of stick although they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick the specific goal keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick which is to give it more surface area to block the ball the uniform consists of shin guards shoes shorts or a skirt a mouthguard and a jersey the game is played globally particularly in parts of western europe south asia southern africa australia new zealand argentina and parts of the united states primarily new england and the mid atlantic states known simply as hockey in most territories the term field hockey is used primarily in canada and the united states where ice hockey is more popular in sweden the term landhockey is used and to some degree in norway where the game is governed by the norges bandyforbund during play goal keepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with any part of their body while field players can only play the ball with the flat side of their stick a player s hand is considered part of the stick if holding the stick if the ball is touched with the rounded part of the stick it will result in a penalty goal keepers also cannot play the ball with the back of their stick the team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins if the score is tied at the end of the game either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or there is a penalty shoot out depending on the format of the competition there are many variations to overtime play that depend on the league or tournament rules in american college play a seven aside overtime period consists of a minute golden goal period with seven players for each team if a tie still remains the game enters a one on one competition where each team chooses five players to dribble from the yard m line down to the circle against the opposing goalie the player has eight seconds to score against the goalie while keeping the ball in bounds the game ends after a goal is scored the ball goes out of bounds a foul is committed ending in either a penalty stroke or flick or the end of the one on one or time expires if the tie still persists more rounds are played until one team has scored the governing body of field hockey is the international hockey federation fih called the fédération internationale de hockey in french with men and women being represented internationally in competitions including the olympic games world cup world league champions trophy and junior world cup with many countries running extensive junior senior and masters club competitions the fih is also responsible for organizing the hockey rules board and developing the rules of the game a popular variant of field hockey is indoor field hockey which differs in a number of respects while embodying the primary principles of hockey indoor hockey is a a side variant using a field which is reduced to approximately m m ft ft although many of the rules remain the same including obstruction and feet there are several key variations players may not raise the ball unless shooting at goal players may not hit the ball instead using pushes to transfer it and the sidelines are replaced with solid barriers from which the ball will rebound and remain in play in addition the regulation guidelines for the indoor field hockey stick require a slightly thinner lighter stick than an outdoor one
Sports	Volleyball	Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.[1] It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. The complete set of rules is extensive,[2] but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court.[3] The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to 3 times, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively.[3] Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack, an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court. The rally continues, with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches, until either (1): a team makes a kill, grounding the ball on the opponent's court and winning the rally; or (2): a team commits a fault and loses the rally. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally. A few of the most common faults include:	volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team s court under organized rules it has been a part of the official program of the summer olympic games since tokyo the complete set of rules is extensive but play essentially proceeds as follows a player on one of the teams begins a rally by serving the ball tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm from behind the back boundary line of the court over the net and into the receiving team s court the receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court the team may touch the ball up to times but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively typically the first two touches are used to set up for an attack an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court the rally continues with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches until either a team makes a kill grounding the ball on the opponent s court and winning the rally or a team commits a fault and loses the rally the team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally a few of the most common faults include
Sports	Basketball	Basketball, colloquially referred to as hoops,[1] is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated. Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots—the lay-up, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling. The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one. Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.[2] The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.[3][4] Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas. The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world.

Sports	Tennis	Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will. Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis.[1] It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis. During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term tennis referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis. The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye. Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the Majors) are especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open also played on hard courts.	tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent singles or between two teams of two players each doubles each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent s court the object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return the player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point while the opposite player will tennis is an olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages the sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket including wheelchair users the modern game of tennis originated in birmingham england in the late century as lawn tennis it had close connections both to various field lawn games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis during most of the century in fact the term tennis referred to real tennis not lawn tennis the rules of modern tennis have changed little since the two exceptions are that from to the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times and the adoption of the tiebreak in the a recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point challenge system which allows a player to contest the line call of a point a system known as hawk eye tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport the four grand slam tournaments also referred to as the majors are especially popular the australian open played on hard courts the french open played on red clay courts wimbledon played on grass courts and the us open also played on hard courts
Sports	Cricket	"Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are ""out""). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information. Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string. The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in the Indian subcontinent, Australasia, the United Kingdom, southern Africa and the West Indies.[1] Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country."	cricket is a bat and ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a yard metre pitch with a wicket at each end each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps the batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat and running between the wickets while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this by preventing the ball from leaving the field and getting the ball to either wicket and dismiss each batter so they are out means of dismissal include being bowled when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket when ten batters have been dismissed the innings ends and the teams swap roles the game is adjudicated by two umpires aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches they communicate with two off field scorers who record the match s statistical information forms of cricket range from with each team batting for a single innings of overs to test matches played over five days traditionally cricketers play in all white kit but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours in addition to the basic kit some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball which is a hard solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string the earliest reference to cricket is in south east england in the mid century it spread globally with the expansion of the british empire with the first international matches in the second half of the century the game s governing body is the international cricket council icc which has over members twelve of which are full members who play test matches the game s rules the laws of cricket are maintained by marylebone cricket club mcc in london the sport is followed primarily in the indian subcontinent australasia the united kingdom southern africa and the west indies women s cricket which is organised and played separately has also achieved international standard the most successful side playing international cricket is australia which has won seven one day international trophies including five world cups more than any other country and has been the top rated test side more than any other country
Sports	Table Tennis	Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball, also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small rackets. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage. Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 1926. ITTF currently includes 226 member associations.[3] The table tennis official rules are specified in the ITTF handbook.[4] Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,[5] with several event categories. From 1988 until 2004, these were men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles and women's doubles. Since 2008, a team event has been played instead of the doubles.	table tennis also known as ping pong and whiff whaff is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball also known as the ping pong ball back and forth across a table using small rackets the game takes place on a hard table divided by a net except for the initial serve the rules are generally as follows players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once a point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules play is fast and demands quick reactions spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent s options giving the hitter a great advantage table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization international table tennis federation ittf founded in ittf currently includes member associations the table tennis official rules are specified in the ittf handbook table tennis has been an olympic sport since with several event categories from until these were men s singles women s singles men s doubles and women s doubles since a team event has been played instead of the doubles
Sports	Boxing	Boxing is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring. Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games—it also has its own World Championships. Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one-to-three-minute intervals called rounds. A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualification of an opponent, or resignation of an opponent.  When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing, the judges' scorecards determine the victor. In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, professional bouts are considered a draw. In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria. While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history, the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC.[2] The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece, where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC.[2] Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules.	boxing is a combat sport in which two people usually wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring amateur boxing is both an olympic and commonwealth games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games it also has its own world championships boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one to three minute intervals called rounds a winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing disqualification of an opponent or resignation of an opponent when the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing the judges scorecards determine the victor in the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges professional bouts are considered a draw in olympic boxing because a winner must be declared judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria while humans have fought in hand to hand combat since the dawn of human history the earliest evidence of fist fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient near east in the and millennia bc the earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to ancient greece where boxing was established as an olympic game in bc boxing evolved from and century prizefights largely in great britain to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid century with the introduction of the marquess of queensberry rules
Sports	Golf	"Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible. Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes, though recreational courses can be smaller, often having nine holes. Each hole on the course must contain a teeing ground to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 4 1⁄4 inches (11 cm) in diameter. There are other standard forms of terrain in between, such as the fairway, rough (long grass), bunkers (or ""sand traps""), and various hazards (water, rocks) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement. Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as stroke play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team, known as match play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels, but most especially at the elite level. The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland. The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764. Golf's first major, and the world's oldest tournament in existence, is The Open Championship, also known as the British Open, which was first played in 1860 at the Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland. This is one of the four major championships in men's professional golf, the other three being played in the United States: The Masters, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship."	golf is a club and ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible golf unlike most ball games cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game the game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of holes though recreational courses can be smaller often having nine holes each hole on the course must contain a teeing ground to start from and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup inches cm in diameter there are other standard forms of terrain in between such as the fairway rough long grass bunkers or sand traps and various hazards water rocks but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual known as stroke play or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team known as match play stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels but most especially at the elite level the modern game of golf originated in century scotland the hole round was created at the old course at st andrews in golf s first major and the world s oldest tournament in existence is the open championship also known as the british open which was first played in at the prestwick golf club in ayrshire scotland this is one of the four major championships in men s professional golf the other three being played in the united states the masters the u s open and the pga championship
Sports	Swimming	Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival.  Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs, the body, or both.  Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response.[1] Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities,[2][3][4][5] and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum.[6]  As a formalized sport, swimming features in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics.	swimming is the self propulsion of a person through water usually for recreation sport exercise or survival locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs the body or both humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth as a survival response swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities and in some countries swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum as a formalized sport swimming features in a range of local national and international competitions including every modern summer olympics
Sports	Handball	"Handball (also known as team handball, European handball or Olympic handball)[3] is a team sport in which two teams of seven players each (six outcourt players and a goalkeeper) pass a ball using their hands with the aim of throwing it into the goal of the other team. A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins. Modern handball is played on a court of 40 by 20 metres (131 by 66 ft), with a goal in the middle of each end. The goals are surrounded by a 6-meter (20 ft) zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed; goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while ""diving"" into it. The sport is usually played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball, Czech handball (which were more common in the past) and beach handball. The game is fast and high-scoring: professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each, though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago. Players may score hat tricks. Body contact is permitted for the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal. No protective equipment is mandated, but players may wear soft protective bands, pads and mouth guards.[4] The game was codified at the end of the 19th century in Denmark. The modern set of rules was published on 29 October 1917 in Berlin, which is seen as the date of birth of the sport,[1][5] and had several revisions since. The first official handball match was played in the same year in Germany.[1] The first international games were played under these rules for men in 1925 and for women in 1930. Men's handball was first played at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin as outdoors, and the next time at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich as indoors, and has been an Olympic sport since. Women's team handball was added at the 1976 Summer Olympics. The International Handball Federation was formed in 1946 and, as of 2016[update], has 197 member federations.[6] The sport is most popular in Europe, and European countries have won all medals but one in the men's world championships since 1938. In the women's world championships, only two non-European countries have won the title: South Korea and Brazil. The game also enjoys popularity in East Asia, North Africa and parts of South America."	handball also known as team handball european handball or olympic handball is a team sport in which two teams of seven players each six outcourt players and a goalkeeper pass a ball using their hands with the aim of throwing it into the goal of the other team a standard match consists of two periods of minutes and the team that scores more goals wins modern handball is played on a court of by metres by ft with a goal in the middle of each end the goals are surrounded by a meter ft zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while diving into it the sport is usually played indoors but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball czech handball which were more common in the past and beach handball the game is fast and high scoring professional teams now typically score between and goals each though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago players may score hat tricks body contact is permitted for the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal no protective equipment is mandated but players may wear soft protective bands pads and mouth guards the game was codified at the end of the century in denmark the modern set of rules was published on october in berlin which is seen as the date of birth of the sport and had several revisions since the first official handball match was played in the same year in germany the first international games were played under these rules for men in and for women in men s handball was first played at the summer olympics in berlin as outdoors and the next time at the summer olympics in munich as indoors and has been an olympic sport since women s team handball was added at the summer olympics the international handball federation was formed in and as of update has member federations the sport is most popular in europe and european countries have won all medals but one in the men s world championships since in the women s world championships only two non european countries have won the title south korea and brazil the game also enjoys popularity in east asia north africa and parts of south america

Sports	Cycling	"Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport.[1] People engaged in cycling are referred to as ""cyclists"",[2] ""bicyclists"",[3] or ""bikers"".[4] Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, ""cycling"" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs). Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide.[5] They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world. Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation[6][7] optimal for short to moderate distances. Bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, and much reduced traffic congestion. These lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required). By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.[8] In addition, cycling provides a variety of health benefits. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that cycling can reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease, and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles.[9] Cycling on stationary bikes have also been used as part of rehabilitation for lower limb injuries, particularly after hip surgery.[10] Individuals who cycle regularly have also reported mental health improvements, including less perceived stress and better vitality.[11] Among the disadvantages of cycling are the requirement of bicycles (excepting tricycles or quadricycles) to be balanced by the rider in order to remain upright, the reduced protection in crashes in comparison to motor vehicles,[12] often longer travel time (except in densely populated areas), vulnerability to weather conditions, difficulty in transporting passengers, and the fact that a basic level of fitness is required for cycling moderate to long distances."	cycling also called bicycling or biking is the use of bicycles for transport recreation exercise or sport people engaged in cycling are referred to as cyclists bicyclists or bikers apart from two wheeled bicycles cycling also includes the riding of unicycles tricycles quadricycles recumbent and similar human powered vehicles hpvs bicycles were introduced in the century and now number approximately one billion worldwide they are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with motor vehicles including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling easier parking increased maneuverability and access to roads bike paths and rural trails cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels less air or noise pollution and much reduced traffic congestion these lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large negligible damage to roads less road area required by fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve in addition cycling provides a variety of health benefits the world health organization who states that cycling can reduce the risk of cancers heart disease and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles cycling on stationary bikes have also been used as part of rehabilitation for lower limb injuries particularly after hip surgery individuals who cycle regularly have also reported mental health improvements including less perceived stress and better vitality among the disadvantages of cycling are the requirement of bicycles excepting tricycles or quadricycles to be balanced by the rider in order to remain upright the reduced protection in crashes in comparison to motor vehicles often longer travel time except in densely populated areas vulnerability to weather conditions difficulty in transporting passengers and the fact that a basic level of fitness is required for cycling moderate to long distances
Sports	Rugby Football	Rugby is a collective name for the family of team sports of rugby union and rugby league, as well as the earlier forms of football from which both games, as well as Australian rules football and Gridiron football evolved. Canadian football and to a lesser extent American football were also broadly considered forms of rugby football but are seldom now referred to as such. The governing body of Canadian football, Football Canada, was known as the Canadian Rugby Union as late as 1967, more than fifty years after the sport parted ways with the established rules of rugby union or league.[1][2][3] Rugby football started about 1845 at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, England although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times. Rugby split into two sports in 1895, when twenty-one clubs split from the Rugby Football Union to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (later renamed the Rugby Football League in 1922) in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, over broken-time payments to players who took time off from work to play the sport, thus making rugby league the first code to turn professional and pay players. Rugby union turned professional one hundred years later in 1995, following the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa.[4][5] The respective world governing bodies are World Rugby (rugby union) and the Rugby League International Federation (rugby league). Rugby football was one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century.[6][7] Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports, with rugby league being much more similar to gridiron football. In addition to these two codes, both American and Canadian football evolved from rugby football in the beginning of the 20th century.	rugby is a collective name for the family of team sports of rugby union and rugby league as well as the earlier forms of football from which both games as well as australian rules football and gridiron football evolved canadian football and to a lesser extent american football were also broadly considered forms of rugby football but are seldom now referred to as such the governing body of canadian football football canada was known as the canadian rugby union as late as more than fifty years after the sport parted ways with the established rules of rugby union or league rugby football started about at rugby school in rugby warwickshire england although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times rugby split into two sports in when twenty one clubs split from the rugby football union to form the northern rugby football union later renamed the rugby football league in in the george hotel huddersfield over broken time payments to players who took time off from work to play the sport thus making rugby league the first code to turn professional and pay players rugby union turned professional one hundred years later in following the rugby world cup in south africa the respective world governing bodies are world rugby rugby union and the rugby league international federation rugby league rugby football was one of many versions of football played at english public schools in the century although rugby league initially used rugby union rules they are now wholly separate sports with rugby league being much more similar to gridiron football in addition to these two codes both american and canadian football evolved from rugby football in the beginning of the century
Instruments	Guitar	"The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings.[1] It is typically played with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings with either a guitar pick or the fingers/fingernails of one hand, while simultaneously fretting (pressing the strings against the frets) with the fingers of the other hand. The sound of the vibrating strings is projected either acoustically, by means of the hollow chamber of the guitar (for an acoustic guitar), or through an electrical amplifier and a speaker. The guitar is a type of chordophone - wherein the sound is produced by way of a string, stretched between two fixed points, vibrating when plucked - traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar), the steel-string acoustic guitar and the archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a ""jazz guitar"". The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive finger-picking technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term ""finger-picking"" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States. The acoustic bass guitar is pitched one octave below a regular guitar. Electric guitars, introduced in the 1930s, use an amplifier and a loudspeaker that both makes the sound of the instrument loud enough for the performers and audience to hear, and, given that it produces an electric signal when played, that can electronically manipulate and shape the tone using an equalizer (e.g., bass and treble tone controls) and a wide variety of electronic effects units, the most commonly used ones being distortion (or ""overdrive"") and reverb. Early amplified guitars employed a hollow body, but solid wood guitars began to dominate during the 1960s and 1970s, as they are less prone to unwanted acoustic feedback ""howls"". As with acoustic guitars, there are a number of types of electric guitars, including hollowbody guitars, archtop guitars (used in jazz guitar, blues and rockabilly) and solid-body guitars, which are widely used in rock music. The loud, amplified sound and sonic power of the electric guitar played through a guitar amp has played a key role in the development of blues and rock music, both as an accompaniment instrument (playing riffs and chords) and performing guitar solos, and in many rock subgenres, notably heavy metal music and punk rock. The electric guitar has had a major influence on popular culture. The guitar is used in a wide variety of musical genres worldwide.

Instruments	Piano	"The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 (the exact year is uncertain), in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a softer material (modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos used leather). It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings. The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte, the Italian term for the early 1700s versions of the instrument,  which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte (key cymbal with quieter and louder)[1] and fortepiano. The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate ""soft"" and ""loud"" respectively,[2] in this context referring to the variations in volume (i.e., loudness) produced in response to a pianist's touch or pressure on the keys: the greater the velocity of a key press, the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings, and the louder the sound of the note produced and the stronger the attack. The name was created as a contrast to harpsichord, a musical instrument that does not allow variation in volume; compared to the harpsichord, the first fortepianos in the 1700s had a quieter sound and smaller dynamic range.[3] A piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings, which are strung under great tension on a heavy metal frame. Pressing one or more keys on the piano's keyboard causes a wooden or plastic hammer (typically padded with firm felt) to strike the strings. The hammer rebounds from the strings, and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency.[4] These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air. When the key is released, a damper stops the strings' vibration, ending the sound. Notes can be sustained, even when the keys are released by the fingers and thumbs, by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument. The sustain pedal enables pianists to play musical passages that would otherwise be impossible, such as sounding a 10-note chord in the lower register and then, while this chord is being continued with the sustain pedal, shifting both hands to the treble range to play a melody and arpeggios over the top of this sustained chord. Unlike the pipe organ and harpsichord, two major keyboard instruments widely used before the piano, the piano allows gradations of volume and tone according to how forcefully or softly a performer presses or strikes the keys. Most modern pianos have a row of 88 black and white keys, 52 white keys for the notes of the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A and B) and 36 shorter black keys, which are raised above the white keys, and set further back on the keyboard. This means that the piano can play 88 different pitches (or ""notes""), going from the deepest bass range to the highest treble. The black keys are for the ""accidentals"" (F♯/G♭, G♯/A♭, A♯/B♭, C♯/D♭, and D♯/E♭), which are needed to play in all twelve keys. More rarely, some pianos have additional keys (which require additional strings). Most notes have three strings, except for the bass, which graduates from one to two. The strings are sounded when keys are pressed or struck, and silenced by dampers when the hands are lifted from the keyboard. Although an acoustic piano has strings, it is usually classified as a percussion instrument rather than as a stringed instrument, because the strings are struck rather than plucked (as with a harpsichord or spinet); in the Hornbostel–Sachs system of instrument classification, pianos are considered chordophones. There are two main types of piano: the grand piano and the upright piano. The grand piano has a better sound and gives the player a more precise control of the keys, and is therefore the preferred choice for every situation in which the available floor-space and the budget will allow, as well as often being considered a requirement in venues where skilled pianists will frequently give public performances. The upright piano, which necessarily involves some compromise in both tone and key action compared to a grand piano of equivalent quality, is nevertheless much more widely used, because it occupies less space (allowing it to fit comfortably in a room where a grand piano would be too large) and is significantly less expensive. During the 1800s, influenced by the musical trends of the Romantic music era, innovations such as the cast iron frame (which allowed much greater string tensions) and aliquot stringing gave grand pianos a more powerful sound, with a longer sustain and richer tone. In the nineteenth century, a family's piano played the same role that a radio or phonograph played in the twentieth century; when a nineteenth-century family wanted to hear a newly published musical piece or symphony, they could hear it by having a family member play a simplified version on the piano. During the nineteenth century, music publishers produced many types of musical works (symphonies, opera overtures, waltzes, etc.) in arrangements for piano, so that music lovers could play and hear the popular pieces of the day in their home. The piano is widely employed in classical, jazz, traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances, accompaniment, and for composing, songwriting and rehearsals. Although the piano is very heavy and thus not portable and is expensive (in comparison with other widely used accompaniment instruments, such as the acoustic guitar), its musical versatility (i.e., its wide pitch range, ability to play chords, louder or softer notes and two or more independent musical lines at the same time), the large number of musicians - both amateurs and professionals - trained in playing it, and its wide availability in performance venues, schools and rehearsal spaces have made it one of the Western world's most familiar musical instruments."	the piano is an

Instruments	Violin	"The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string instrument) in the violin family. Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the family in regular use.[a] The violin typically has four strings, usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. It can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow (col legno). Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments. Violins are also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music and in jazz. Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion, with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound. The violin has come to be incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it. The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection. In Europe, it served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music, such as the viola.[1][2][3] Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari, Guarneri, Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) and by Jacob Stainer in Austria. According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or equal it, though this belief is disputed.[4][5] Great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced commercial ""trade violins"" coming from cottage industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt. Many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers. The components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood. Violins can be strung with gut, Perlon or other synthetic, or steel strings. A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker. One who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or bowmaker."	the violin sometimes known as a fiddle is a wooden chordophone string instrument in the violin family most violins have a hollow wooden body it is the smallest and thus highest pitched instrument soprano in the family in regular use a the violin typically has four strings usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings it can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers pizzicato and in specialized cases by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow col legno violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres they are most prominent in the western classical tradition both in ensembles from chamber music to orchestras and as solo instruments violins are also important in many varieties of folk music including country music bluegrass music and in jazz electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound the violin has come to be incorporated in many non western music cultures including indian music and iranian music the name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it the violin was first known in century italy with some further modifications occurring in the and centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection in europe it served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in western classical music such as the viola violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the stradivari guarneri guadagnini and amati families from the to the century in brescia and cremona italy and by jacob stainer in austria according to their reputation the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or equal it though this belief is disputed great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of less famous makers as well as still greater numbers of mass produced commercial trade violins coming from cottage industries in places such as saxony bohemia and mirecourt many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by sears roebuck and co and other mass merchandisers the components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood violins can be strung with gut perlon or other synthetic or steel strings a person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker one who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or bowmaker
Instruments	Drums	"A drum kit – also called a drum set, trap set (an abbreviation of the word ""contraption"")[1] or simply drums – is a collection of drums, cymbals and other percussion instruments, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player,[2] with drumsticks held in both hands and the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. A drum kit consists of a mix of drums (categorized classically as membranophones, Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 2) and idiophones ⁠– ⁠most significantly cymbals, but can also include the woodblock and cowbell (classified as Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 1).[3] In the 2000s, some kits also include electronic instruments (Hornbostel-Sachs classification 53). Also, both hybrid (mixing acoustic instruments and electronic drums) and entirely electronic kits are used. A standard modern kit (for a right-handed player), as used in popular music and taught in music schools,[4][5][6] contains:"	a drum kit also called a drum set trap set an abbreviation of the word contraption or simply drums is a collection of drums cymbals and other percussion instruments which are set up on stands to be played by a single player with drumsticks held in both hands and the feet operating pedals that control the hi hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum a drum kit consists of a mix of drums categorized classically as membranophones hornbostel sachs high level classification and idiophones most significantly cymbals but can also include the woodblock and cowbell classified as hornbostel sachs high level classification in the some kits also include electronic instruments hornbostel sachs classification also both hybrid mixing acoustic instruments and electronic drums and entirely electronic kits are used a standard modern kit for a right handed player as used in popular music and taught in music schools contains
Instruments	Saxophone	"The saxophone (referred to colloquially as the sax) is a family of woodwind instruments usually made of brass and played with a single-reed mouthpiece.[2] Although most saxophones are made from brass, they are categorized as woodwind instruments, because sound is produced by an oscillating reed (traditionally made out of woody cane) rather than lips vibrating in a mouthpiece cup as with the brass instrument family. As with the other woodwind instruments, the pitch of the note being played is controlled by covering holes in the body tube to control the resonant frequency of the air column by changing the effective length of the tube.[3] The player covers or uncovers the holes by pressing keys. The saxophone is used in classical music (such as concert bands, chamber music, solo repertoire, and, occasionally, orchestras), military bands, marching bands, jazz (such as big bands and jazz combos), and contemporary music. The saxophone is also used as a solo and melody instrument or as a member of a horn section in some styles of rock and roll and popular music. Saxophone players are called saxophonists.[2] Since the first saxophone was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in the early 1840s,[4] saxophones have been produced in a variety of series distinguished by transpositions within instrument sets and tuning standard. Sax patented the saxophone on 28 June 1846, in two groups of seven instruments each. Each series consisted of instruments ranked by pitch, in alternating transposition. The series pitched in B♭ and E♭ soon became dominant and most saxophones encountered today are from this series. Instruments from the series pitched in C and F never gained a foothold and constituted only a small percentage of instruments made by Sax. High Pitch (also marked ""H"" or ""HP"") saxophones tuned sharper than the (concert) A = 440 Hz standard were produced into the early twentieth century for sonic qualities suited for outdoor uses, but are not playable to modern tuning and are considered obsolete. Low Pitch (also marked ""L"" or ""LP"") saxophones are equivalent in tuning to modern instruments. C soprano and C melody saxophones were produced for the casual market as parlor instruments during the early twentieth century. Saxophones in F were introduced during the late 1920s but never gained acceptance. The modern saxophone family consists entirely of instruments in the B♭ – E♭ series, historical and experimental instruments notwithstanding.

Instruments	Cello	The cello (/ˈtʃɛloʊ/ CHEL-oh; plural celli or cellos) or violoncello (/ˌvaɪələnˈtʃɛloʊ/ VY-ə-lən-CHEL-oh;[1] Italian pronunciation: [vjolonˈtʃɛllo]) is a bowed (and occasionally plucked) string instrument of the violin family. Its four strings are usually tuned in perfect fifths: from low to high, C2, G2, D3 and A3. The viola's four strings are each an octave higher. Music for the cello is generally written in the bass clef, with tenor clef and treble clef used for higher-range passages. Played by a cellist or violoncellist, it enjoys a large solo repertoire with and without accompaniment, as well as numerous concerti. As a solo instrument, the cello uses its whole range, from bass to soprano, and in chamber music such as string quartets and the orchestra's string section, it often plays the bass part, where it may be reinforced an octave lower by the double basses. Figured bass music of the Baroque-era typically assumes a cello, viola da gamba or bassoon as part of the basso continuo group alongside chordal instruments such as organ, harpsichord, lute or theorbo. Cellos are found in many other ensembles, from modern Chinese orchestras to cello rock bands.	the cello ˈtʃɛloʊ chel oh plural celli or cellos or violoncello ˌvaɪələnˈtʃɛloʊ vy ə lən chel oh italian pronunciation vjolonˈtʃɛllo is a bowed and occasionally plucked string instrument of the violin family its four strings are usually tuned in perfect fifths from low to high and the viola s four strings are each an octave higher music for the cello is generally written in the bass clef with tenor clef and treble clef used for higher range passages played by a cellist or violoncellist it enjoys a large solo repertoire with and without accompaniment as well as numerous concerti as a solo instrument the cello uses its whole range from bass to soprano and in chamber music such as string quartets and the orchestra s string section it often plays the bass part where it may be reinforced an octave lower by the double basses figured bass music of the baroque era typically assumes a cello viola da gamba or bassoon as part of the basso continuo group alongside chordal instruments such as organ harpsichord lute or theorbo cellos are found in many other ensembles from modern chinese orchestras to cello rock bands
Instruments	Flute	"The flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group. Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of Hornbostel–Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones.[1] A musician who plays the flute can be referred to as a flute player, flautist, flutist or, less commonly, fluter or flutenist. Flutes are the earliest known identifiable musical instruments, as paleolithic examples with hand-bored holes have been found. A number of flutes dating to about 43,000 to 35,000 years ago have been found in the Swabian Jura region of present-day Germany. These flutes demonstrate that a developed musical tradition existed from the earliest period of modern human presence in Europe.[2][3] While the oldest flutes currently known were found in Europe, Asia too has a long history with the instrument that has continued into the present day. In China, a playable bone flute was discovered, dated approximately 9000 years old.[4] The Americas also had an ancient flute culture, with instruments found in Caral, Peru, dating back 5000 years [5] and Labrador dating back approximately 7500 years.[6] Historians have found the bamboo flute has a long history as well, especially in China and India. Flutes have been discovered in historical records and artworks starting in the Zhou dynasty. The oldest written sources reveal the Chinese were using the kuan (a reed instrument) and hsio (or xiao, an end-blown flute, often of bamboo) in the 12th-11th centuries B.C., followed by the chi (or ch'ih) in the 9th century B.C. and the yüeh in the 8th century B.C.[7]  Of these, the chi is the oldest documented cross flute or transverse flute, and was made from bamboo.[7][8] The cross flute (Sanscrit: vāṃśī) was ""the outstanding wind instrument of ancient India,"" according to Curt Sachs.[9] He said that religious artwork depicting ""celestial music"" instruments was linked to music with an ""aristocratic character.""[9] The Indian bamboo cross flute, Bansuri, was sacred to Krishna, and he is depicted in Hindu art with the instrument.[9] In India, the cross flute appeared in reliefs from the 1st century A.D. at Sanchi and Amaravati from the 2nd-4th centuries A.D.[9][10] Although there had been flutes in Europe in prehistoric times, in more recent millenia the flute was absent from the subcontinent until its arrival from Asia, by way of ""North Africa, Hungary, and Bohemia,"" according to historian Alexander Buchner.[11] The end-blown flute began to be seen in illustration in the 11th century.[11] Transverse flutes entered Europe through Byzantium and were depicted in Greek art about 800 A.D.[12] The transverse flute had spread into Europe by way of Germany, and was known as the German flute.[12]"	the flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group unlike woodwind instruments with reeds a flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening according to the instrument classification of hornbostel sachs flutes are categorized as edge blown aerophones a musician who plays the flute can be referred to as a flute player flautist flutist or less commonly fluter or flutenist flutes are the earliest known identifiable musical instruments as paleolithic examples with hand bored holes have been found a number of flutes dating to about to years ago have been found in the swabian jura region of present day germany these flutes demonstrate that a developed musical tradition existed from the earliest period of modern human presence in europe while the oldest flutes currently known were found in europe asia too has a long history with the instrument that has continued into the present day in china a playable bone flute was discovered dated approximately years old the americas also had an ancient flute culture with instruments found in caral peru dating back years and labrador dating back approximately years historians have found the bamboo flute has a long history as well especially in china and india flutes have been discovered in historical records and artworks starting in the zhou dynasty the oldest written sources reveal the chinese were using the kuan a reed instrument and hsio or xiao an end blown flute often of bamboo in the centuries b c followed by the chi or ch ih in the century b c and the yüeh in the century b c of these the chi is the oldest documented cross flute or transverse flute and was made from bamboo the cross flute sanscrit vāṃśī was the outstanding wind instrument of ancient india according to curt sachs he said that religious artwork depicting celestial music instruments was linked to music with an aristocratic character the indian bamboo cross flute bansuri was sacred to krishna and he is depicted in hindu art with the instrument in india the cross flute appeared in reliefs from the century a d at sanchi and amaravati from the centuries a d although there had been flutes in europe in prehistoric times in more recent millenia the flute was absent from the subcontinent until its arrival from asia by way of north africa hungary and bohemia according to historian alexander buchner the end blown flute began to be seen in illustration in the century transverse flutes entered europe through byzantium and were depicted in greek art about a d the transverse flute had spread into europe by way of germany and was known as the german flute
Instruments	Clarinet	"The clarinet is a family of woodwind instruments. It has a single-reed mouthpiece, a straight, cylindrical tube with an almost cylindrical bore, and a flared bell. A person who plays a clarinet is called a clarinetist (sometimes spelled clarinettist). While the similarity in sound between the earliest clarinets and the trumpet may hold a clue to its name,  other factors may have been involved. During the Late Baroque era, composers such as Bach and Handel were making new demands on the skills of their trumpeters, who were often required to play difficult melodic passages in the high, or as it came to be called, clarion register. Since the trumpets of this time had no valves or pistons, melodic passages would often require the use of the highest part of the trumpet's range, where the harmonics were close enough together to produce scales of adjacent notes as opposed to the gapped scales or arpeggios of the lower register. The trumpet parts that required this specialty were known by the term clarino and this in turn came to apply to the musicians themselves. It is probable that the term clarinet may stem from the diminutive version of the 'clarion' or 'clarino' and it has been suggested that clarino players may have helped themselves out by playing particularly difficult passages on these newly developed ""mock trumpets"".[1] Johann Christoph Denner is generally believed to have invented the clarinet in Germany around the year 1700 by adding a register key to the earlier chalumeau, usually in the key of C. Over time, additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve the tone and playability.[2] In modern times, the most common clarinet is the B♭ clarinet. However, the clarinet in A, pitched a semitone lower, is regularly used in orchestral, chamber and solo music. An orchestral clarinetist must own both a clarinet in A and B♭ since the repertoire is divided fairly evenly between the two. Since the middle of the 19th century, the bass clarinet (nowadays invariably in B♭ but with extra keys to extend the register down to low written C3) has become an essential addition to the orchestra.

Instruments	Trumpet	"The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet with the highest register in the brass family, to the bass trumpet, which is pitched one octave below the standard B♭ or C Trumpet. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signalling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BCE. They began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century.[1] Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through nearly-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a ""buzzing"" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument.[2] Since the late 15th century, trumpets have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape.[3] There are many distinct types of trumpet, with the most common being pitched in B♭ (a transposing instrument), having a tubing length of about 1.48 m (4 ft 10 in). Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing, whereas modern instruments generally have three (or sometimes four) valves in order to change their pitch. There are eight combinations of three valves, making seven different tubing lengths, with the third valve sometimes used as an alternate fingering equivalent to the 1–2 combination. Most trumpets have valves of the piston type, while some have the rotary type. The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings (especially in German and German-style orchestras), although this practice varies by country. Each valve, when engaged, increases the length of tubing, lowering the pitch of the instrument. A musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter.[4]"	the trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles the trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet with the highest register in the brass family to the bass trumpet which is pitched one octave below the standard b or c trumpet trumpet like instruments have historically been used as signalling devices in battle or hunting with examples dating back to at least bce they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late or early century trumpets are used in art music styles for instance in orchestras concert bands and jazz ensembles as well as in popular music they are played by blowing air through nearly closed lips called the player s embouchure producing a buzzing sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument since the late century trumpets have primarily been constructed of brass tubing usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape there are many distinct types of trumpet with the most common being pitched in b a transposing instrument having a tubing length of about m ft in early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing whereas modern instruments generally have three or sometimes four valves in order to change their pitch there are eight combinations of three valves making seven different tubing lengths with the third valve sometimes used as an alternate fingering equivalent to the combination most trumpets have valves of the piston type while some have the rotary type the use of rotary valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings especially in german and german style orchestras although this practice varies by country each valve when engaged increases the length of tubing lowering the pitch of the instrument a musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter
Instruments	Pipe Organ	"The pipe organ is a musical instrument that produces sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through the organ pipes selected from a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes are provided in sets called ranks, each of which has a common timbre and volume throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have many ranks of pipes of differing timbre, pitch, and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops. A pipe organ has one or more keyboards (called manuals) played by the hands, and a pedal clavier played by the feet; each keyboard controls its own division, or group of stops. The keyboard(s), pedalboard, and stops are housed in the organ's console. The organ's continuous supply of wind allows it to sustain notes for as long as the corresponding keys are pressed, unlike the piano and harpsichord whose sound begins to dissipate immediately after a key is depressed. The smallest portable pipe organs may have only one or two dozen pipes and one manual; the largest may have over 33,000 pipes and seven manuals.[2] A list of some of the most notable and largest pipe organs in the world can be viewed at List of pipe organs. A list consisting the ranking of the largest organs in the world—based on the criterion constructed by Michał Szostak, i.e. 'the number of ranks and additional equipment managed from a single console—can be found in 'The Organ'[3] and in 'The Vox Humana'.[4] The origins of the pipe organ can be traced back to the hydraulis in Ancient Greece, in the 3rd century BC,[5] in which the wind supply was created by the weight of displaced water in an airtight container. By the 6th or 7th century AD, bellows were used to supply Byzantine organs with wind.[5][6] Beginning in the 12th century, the organ began to evolve into a complex instrument capable of producing different timbres. A pipe organ with ""great leaden pipes"" was sent to the West by the Byzantine emperor Constantine V as a gift to Pepin the Short, King of the Franks, in 757.[7]  Pepin's son Charlemagne requested a similar organ for his chapel in Aachen in 812, beginning the pipe organ's establishment in Western European church music.[8]   In England, ""The first organ of which any detailed record exists was built in Winchester Cathedral in the 10th century. It was a huge machine with 400 pipes, which needed two men to play it and 70 men to blow it, and its sound could be heard throughout the city.""[9]  By the 17th century, most of the sounds available on the modern classical organ had been developed.[10] From that time, the pipe organ was the most complex man-made device[11]—a distinction it retained until it was displaced by the telephone exchange in the late 19th century.[12] Pipe organs are installed in churches, synagogues, concert halls, schools, other public buildings and in private properties. They are used in the performance of classical music, sacred music, secular music, and popular music. In the early 20th century, pipe organs were installed in theaters to accompany the screening of films during the silent movie era; in municipal auditoria, where orchestral transcriptions were popular; and in the homes of the wealthy.[13] The beginning of the 21st century has seen a resurgence in installations in concert halls. The organ boasts a substantial repertoire, which spans over 500 years.[14]"	the pipe organ is a musical instrument that produces sound by driving pressurized air called wind through the organ pipes selected from a keyboard because each pipe produces a single pitch the pipes are provided in sets called ranks each of which has a common timbre and volume throughout the keyboard compass most organs have many ranks of pipes of differing timbre pitch and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops a pipe organ has one or more keyboards called manuals played by the hands and a pedal clavier played by the feet each keyboard controls its own division or group of stops the keyboard s pedalboard and stops are housed in the organ s console the organ s continuous supply of wind allows it to sustain notes for as long as the corresponding keys are pressed unlike the piano and harpsichord whose sound begins to dissipate immediately after a key is depressed the smallest portable pipe organs may have only one or two dozen pipes and one manual the largest may have over pipes and seven manuals a list of some of the most notable and largest pipe organs in the world can be viewed at list of pipe organs a list consisting the ranking of the largest organs in the world based on the criterion constructed by michał szostak i e the number of ranks and additional equipment managed from a single console can be found in the organ and in the vox humana the origins of the pipe organ can be traced back to the hydraulis in ancient greece in the century bc in which the wind supply was created by the weight of displaced water in an airtight container by the or century ad bellows were used to supply byzantine organs with wind beginning in the century the organ began to evolve into a complex instrument capable of producing different timbres a pipe organ with great leaden pipes was sent to the west by the byzantine emperor constantine v as a gift to pepin the short king of the franks in pepin s son charlemagne requested a similar organ for his chapel in aachen in beginning the pipe organ s establishment in western european church music in england the first organ of which any detailed record exists was built in winchester cathedral in the century it was a huge machine with pipes which needed two men to play it and men to blow it and its sound could be heard throughout the city by the century most of the sounds available on the modern classical organ had been developed from that time the pipe organ was the most complex man made device a distinction it retained until it was displaced by the telephone exchange in the late century pipe organs are installed in churches synagogues concert halls schools other public buildings and in private properties they are used in the performance of classical music sacred music secular music and popular music in the early century pipe organs were installed in theaters to accompany the screening of films during the silent movie era in municipal auditoria where orchestral transcriptions were popular and in the homes of the wealthy the beginning of the century has seen a resurgence in installations in concert halls the organ boasts a substantial repertoire which spans over years

It generally employs four nylon strings.[1][2][3] The ukulele is a small guitar-like instrument, which was introduced to Hawaii by Portuguese immigrants from Madeira. It gained great popularity elsewhere in the United States during the early 20th century and from there spread internationally. The tone and volume of the instrument vary with size and construction. Ukuleles commonly come in four sizes: soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone.	the ukulele ˌjuːkəˈleɪli yoo kə lay lee from hawaiian ʻukulele ˈʔukuˈlɛlɛ approximately oo koo leh leh is a member of the lute family of instruments it generally employs four nylon strings the ukulele is a small guitar like instrument which was introduced to hawaii by portuguese immigrants from madeira it gained great popularity elsewhere in the united states during the early century and from there spread internationally the tone and volume of the instrument vary with size and construction ukuleles commonly come in four sizes soprano concert tenor and baritone
Instruments	Trombone	"The trombone is a musical instrument in the brass family. As with all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips (embouchure) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Unlike most other brass instruments, which have valves that, when pressed, alter the pitch of the instrument, trombones instead have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch. However, many modern trombone models also have a valve attachment which lowers the pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves similar to those on the trumpet. The word ""trombone"" derives from Italian Tromba (trumpet) and -one (a suffix meaning ""large""), so the name means ""large trumpet"". The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart, the baritone, in contrast to its conical valved counterparts: the cornet, the euphonium, and the French horn. The most frequently encountered trombones are the tenor trombone and bass trombone. The most common variant, the tenor, is a non-transposing instrument pitched in B♭, an octave below the B♭ trumpet and an octave above the pedal B♭ tuba. The once common E♭ alto trombone became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, but it is now resurging due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works. Trombone music is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef, although exceptions do occur, notably in British brass-band music where the tenor trombone is presented as a B♭ transposing instrument, written in treble clef. A person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player."	the trombone is a musical instrument in the brass family as with all brass instruments sound is produced when the player s vibrating lips embouchure cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate unlike most other brass instruments which have valves that when pressed alter the pitch of the instrument trombones instead have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch however many modern trombone models also have a valve attachment which lowers the pitch of the instrument variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves similar to those on the trumpet the word trombone derives from italian tromba trumpet and one a suffix meaning large so the name means large trumpet the trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart the baritone in contrast to its conical valved counterparts the cornet the euphonium and the french horn the most frequently encountered trombones are the tenor trombone and bass trombone the most common variant the tenor is a non transposing instrument pitched in b an octave below the b trumpet and an octave above the pedal b tuba the once common e alto trombone became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor but it is now resurging due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works trombone music is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef although exceptions do occur notably in british brass band music where the tenor trombone is presented as a b transposing instrument written in treble clef a person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player
Instruments	Viola	"The viola (/viˈoʊlə/ vee-OH-lə,[1][2] also UK: /vaɪˈoʊlə/ vy-OH-lə,[3][4][a] Italian: [ˈvjɔːla, viˈɔːla]) is a string instrument that is bowed, plucked, or played with varying techniques. It is slightly larger than a violin and has a lower and deeper sound. Since the 18th century, it has been the middle or alto voice of the violin family, between the violin (which is tuned a perfect fifth above) and the cello (which is tuned an octave below).[5] The strings from low to high are typically tuned to C3, G3, D4, and A4. In the past, the viola varied in size and style, as did its names.[citation needed] The word viola originates from the Italian language. The Italians often used the term: viola da braccio meaning literally: 'of the arm'. ""Brazzo"" was another Italian word for the viola, which the Germans adopted as Bratsche. The French had their own names: cinquiesme was a small viola, haute contre was a large viola, and taile was a tenor. Today, the French use the term alto, a reference to its range. The viola was popular in the heyday of five-part harmony, up until the eighteenth century, taking three lines of the harmony and occasionally playing the melody line.[citation needed] Music for the viola differs from most other instruments in that it primarily uses the alto clef. When viola music has substantial sections in a higher register, it switches to the treble clef to make it easier to read. The viola often plays the ""inner voices"" in string quartets and symphonic writing, and it is more likely than the first violin to play accompaniment parts. The viola occasionally plays a major, soloistic role in orchestral music. Examples include the symphonic poem, ""Don Quixote"", by Richard Strauss, and the symphony/concerto, ""Harold en Italie"", by Hector Berlioz.[citation needed] In the earlier part of the 20th century, more composers began to write for the viola, encouraged by the emergence of specialized soloists such as Lionel Tertis and William Primrose. English composers Arthur Bliss, York Bowen, Benjamin Dale, Frank Bridge, Benjamin Britten, Rebecca Clarke and Ralph Vaughan Williams all wrote substantial chamber and concert works.[citation needed] Many of these pieces were commissioned by, or written for Lionel Tertis.[citation needed] William Walton, Bohuslav Martinů, Toru Takemitsu, Tibor Serly, Alfred Schnittke, and Béla Bartók have written well-known viola concertos. The concerti by Béla Bartók, Paul Hindemith, Carl Stamitz, Georg Philipp Telemann, and William Walton are considered major works of the viola repertoire.[citation needed] Paul Hindemith, who was a violist, wrote a substantial amount of music for viola, including the concerto, ""Der Schwanendreher""."	the viola viˈoʊlə vee oh lə also uk vaɪˈoʊlə vy oh lə a italian ˈvjɔːla viˈɔːla is a string instrument that is bowed plucked or played with varying techniques it is slightly larger than a violin and has a lower and deeper sound since the century it has been the middle or alto voice of the violin family between the violin which is tuned a perfect fifth above and the cello which is tuned an octave below the strings from low to high are typically tuned to and in the past the viola varied in size and style as did its names citation needed the word viola originates from the italian language the italians often used the term viola da braccio meaning literally of the arm brazzo was another italian word for the viola which the germans adopted as bratsche the french had their own names cinquiesme was a small viola haute contre was a large viola and taile was a tenor today the french use the term alto a reference to its range the viola was popular in the heyday of five part harmony up until the eighteenth century taking three lines of the harmony and occasionally playing the melody line citation needed music for the viola differs from most other instruments in that it primarily uses the alto clef when viola music has substantial sections in a higher register it switches to the treble clef to make it easier to read the viola often plays the inner voices in string quartets and symphonic writing and it is more likely than the first violin to play accompaniment parts the viola occasionally plays a major soloistic role in orchestral music examples include the symphonic poem don quixote by richard strauss and the symphony concerto harold en italie by hector berlioz citation needed in the earlier part of the century more composers began to write for the viola encouraged by the emergence of specialized soloists such as lionel tertis and william primrose english composers arthur bliss york bowen benjamin dale frank bridge benjamin britten rebecca clarke and ralph vaughan williams all wrote substantial chamber and concert works citation needed many of these pieces were commissioned by or written for lionel tertis citation needed william walton bohuslav martinů toru takemitsu tibor serly alfred schnittke and béla bartók have written well known viola concertos the concerti by béla bartók paul hindemith carl stamitz georg philipp telemann and william walton are considered major works of the viola repertoire citation needed paul hindemith who was a violist wrote a substantial amount of music for viola including the concerto der schwanendreher
Instruments	Double bass	The double bass, also known simply as the bass (or by other names), is the largest and lowest-pitched bowed (or plucked) string instrument[1] in the modern symphony orchestra. The bass is a standard member of the orchestra's string section,[2] as well as the concert band, and is featured in concertos, solo, and chamber music in Western classical music.[3] The bass is used in a range of other genres, such as jazz, 1950s-style blues and rock and roll, rockabilly, psychobilly, traditional country music, bluegrass, tango and many types of folk music. The bass is a transposing instrument and is typically notated one octave higher than tuned to avoid excessive ledger lines below the staff. The double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths[4] (like a viol), rather than fifths, with strings usually tuned to E1, A1, D2 and G2. The instrument's exact lineage is still a matter of some debate, with scholars divided on whether the bass is derived from the viol or the violin family. The double bass is played with a bow (arco), or by plucking the strings (pizzicato), or via a variety of extended techniques. In orchestral repertoire and tango music, both arco and pizzicato are employed. In jazz, blues, and rockabilly, pizzicato is the norm. Classical music uses the natural sound produced acoustically by the instrument, as does traditional bluegrass. In jazz, blues, reggae, and related genres, the bass is frequently amplified.	the double bass also known simply as the bass or by other names is the largest and lowest pitched bowed or plucked string instrument in the modern symphony orchestra the bass is a standard member of the orchestra s string section as well as the concert band and is featured in concertos solo and chamber music in western classical music the bass is used in a range of other genres such as jazz style blues and rock and roll rockabilly psychobilly traditional country music bluegrass tango and many types of folk music the bass is a transposing instrument and is typically notated one octave higher than tuned to avoid excessive ledger lines below the staff the double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths like a viol rather than fifths with strings usually tuned to and the instrument s exact lineage is still a matter of some debate with scholars divided on whether the bass is derived from the viol or the violin family the double bass is played with a bow arco or by plucking the strings pizzicato or via a variety of extended techniques in orchestral repertoire and tango music both arco and pizzicato are employed in jazz blues and rockabilly pizzicato is the norm classical music uses the natural sound produced acoustically by the instrument as does traditional bluegrass in jazz blues reggae and related genres the bass is frequently amplified

Degas also produced bronze sculptures, prints and drawings. Degas is especially identified with the subject of dance; more than half of his works depict dancers.[3] Although Degas is regarded as one of the founders of Impressionism, he rejected the term, preferring to be called a realist,[4] and did not paint outdoors as many Impressionists did. Degas was a superb draftsman, and particularly masterly in depicting movement, as can be seen in his rendition of dancers and bathing female nudes. In addition to ballet dancers and bathing women, Degas painted racehorses and racing jockeys, as well as portraits. His portraits are notable for their psychological complexity and for their portrayal of human isolation.[5] At the beginning of his career, Degas wanted to be a history painter, a calling for which he was well prepared by his rigorous academic training and close study of classical art. In his early thirties, he changed course, and by bringing the traditional methods of a history painter to bear on contemporary subject matter, he became a classical painter of modern life.[6]	edgar degas uk ˈdeɪɡɑː us deɪˈɡɑː dəˈɡɑː born hilaire germain edgar de gas french ilɛːʁ ʒɛʁmɛ ɛdɡaʁ də ɡa july september was a french impressionist artist famous for his pastel drawings and oil paintings degas also produced bronze sculptures prints and drawings degas is especially identified with the subject of dance more than half of his works depict dancers although degas is regarded as one of the founders of impressionism he rejected the term preferring to be called a realist and did not paint outdoors as many impressionists did degas was a superb draftsman and particularly masterly in depicting movement as can be seen in his rendition of dancers and bathing female nudes in addition to ballet dancers and bathing women degas painted racehorses and racing jockeys as well as portraits his portraits are notable for their psychological complexity and for their portrayal of human isolation at the beginning of his career degas wanted to be a history painter a calling for which he was well prepared by his rigorous academic training and close study of classical art in his early thirties he changed course and by bringing the traditional methods of a history painter to bear on contemporary subject matter he became a classical painter of modern life
Painters	Paul Kane	"Paul Kane (September 3, 1810 – February 20, 1871)[1] was an Irish-born Canadian painter, famous for his paintings of First Nations peoples in the Canadian West and other Native Americans in the Columbia District. A largely self-educated artist,[2] Paul Kane grew up in York, Upper Canada (now Toronto) and trained himself by copying European masters on a ""Grand Tour"" study trip through Europe. He undertook two voyages through the Canadian northwest in 1845 and from 1846 to 1848. The first trip took him from Toronto to Sault Ste. Marie and back. Having secured the support of the Hudson's Bay Company, he set out on a second, much longer voyage from Toronto across the Rocky Mountains to Fort Vancouver (present-day Vancouver, Washington) and Fort Victoria (present day Victoria, British Columbia). On both trips Kane sketched and painted First Nations and Métis peoples. Upon his return to Toronto, he produced more than one hundred oil paintings from these sketches. The oil paintings he completed in his studio are considered a part of the Canadian heritage, although he often embellished them considerably, departing from the accuracy of his field sketches in favour of more dramatic scenes. Kane's work followed the tenets of salvage ethnography.[3]"	paul kane september february was an irish born canadian painter famous for his paintings of first nations peoples in the canadian west and other native americans in the columbia district a largely self educated artist paul kane grew up in york upper canada now toronto and trained himself by copying european masters on a grand tour study trip through europe he undertook two voyages through the canadian northwest in and from to the first trip took him from toronto to sault ste marie and back having secured the support of the hudson s bay company he set out on a second much longer voyage from toronto across the rocky mountains to fort vancouver present day vancouver washington and fort victoria present day victoria british columbia on both trips kane sketched and painted first nations and métis peoples upon his return to toronto he produced more than one hundred oil paintings from these sketches the oil paintings he completed in his studio are considered a part of the canadian heritage although he often embellished them considerably departing from the accuracy of his field sketches in favour of more dramatic scenes kane s work followed the tenets of salvage ethnography
Painters	Giacomo Ceruti	"Giacomo Antonio Melchiorre Ceruti (October 13, 1698 – August 28, 1767) was an Italian late Baroque painter, active in Northern Italy in Milan, Brescia, and Venice. He acquired the nickname Pitocchetto (the little beggar) for his many paintings of peasants dressed in rags. He was born in Milan, but worked primarily in Brescia. He may have been influenced early by Antonio Cifrondi and/or Giacomo Todesco (Todeschini), and received training from Carlo Ceresa. While he also painted still-life paintings and religious scenes, Ceruti is best known for his genre paintings, especially of beggars and the poor, whom he painted realistically and endowed with unusual dignity and individuality.  Ceruti gave particular attention to this subject matter during the period 1725 to 1740, and about 50 of his genre paintings from these years survive.[1] Mira Pajes Merriman,  in her essay titled Comedy, Reality, and the Development of Genre Painting in Italy, observes that ""Generally his figures do almost nothing—after all, they have nothing to do.""[2] She describes his paintings as confronting us with"	giacomo antonio melchiorre ceruti october august was an italian late baroque painter active in northern italy in milan brescia and venice he acquired the nickname pitocchetto the little beggar for his many paintings of peasants dressed in rags he was born in milan but worked primarily in brescia he may have been influenced early by antonio cifrondi and or giacomo todesco todeschini and received training from carlo ceresa while he also painted still life paintings and religious scenes ceruti is best known for his genre paintings especially of beggars and the poor whom he painted realistically and endowed with unusual dignity and individuality ceruti gave particular attention to this subject matter during the period to and about of his genre paintings from these years survive mira pajes merriman in her essay titled comedy reality and the development of genre painting in italy observes that generally his figures do almost nothing after all they have nothing to do she describes his paintings as confronting us with

He was also a poet and art teacher, and his posthumously published reminiscences give a chatty and often vivid picture of life in the circle of the Pre-Raphaelites; he was especially close to Dante Gabriel Rossetti.   After growing up in Edinburgh, he moved to London, and from 1843 to 1864 was principal of the government School of Art in Newcastle upon Tyne, where he added industrial subjects to his repertoire of landscapes and history painting.  He was one of the first British artists to extensively depict the processes of the Industrial Revolution. He returned to London, working for the Science and Art Department until 1885.[1] He painted a cycle of historical subjects mixed with scenes from modern industry for Wallington Hall in Northumberland (now National Trust), his best known works, and a purely historical cycle for Penkill Castle in Ayrshire in Scotland.	william bell scott was a scottish artist in oils and watercolour and occasionally printmaking he was also a poet and art teacher and his posthumously published reminiscences give a chatty and often vivid picture of life in the circle of the pre raphaelites he was especially close to dante gabriel rossetti after growing up in edinburgh he moved to london and from to was principal of the government school of art in newcastle upon tyne where he added industrial subjects to his repertoire of landscapes and history painting he was one of the first british artists to extensively depict the processes of the industrial revolution he returned to london working for the science and art department until he painted a cycle of historical subjects mixed with scenes from modern industry for wallington hall in northumberland now national trust his best known works and a purely historical cycle for penkill castle in ayrshire in scotland

Painters	Jackson Pollock	"Paul Jackson Pollock /ˈpɒlək/ (January 28, 1912 – August 11, 1956) was an American painter and a major figure in the abstract expressionist movement. He was widely noticed for his technique of pouring or splashing liquid household paint onto a horizontal surface (""drip technique""), enabling him to view and paint his canvases from all angles. It was also called All-over painting and ""action painting"", since he covered the entire canvas and used the force of his whole body to paint, often in a frenetic dancing style. This extreme form of abstraction divided the critics: some praised the immediacy of the creation, while others derided the random effects. In 2016, Pollock's painting titled Number 17A was reported to have fetched US$200 million in a private purchase. A reclusive and volatile personality, Pollock struggled with alcoholism for most of his life.

Painters	Alfred Sisley	Alfred Sisley (/ˈsɪsli/; French: [sislɛ]; 30 October 1839 – 29 January 1899) was an Impressionist landscape painter who was born and spent most of his life in France, but retained British citizenship. He was the most consistent of the Impressionists in his dedication to painting landscape en plein air (i.e., outdoors). He deviated into figure painting only rarely and, unlike Renoir and Pissarro, found that Impressionism fulfilled his artistic needs. Among his important works are a series of paintings of the River Thames, mostly around Hampton Court, executed in 1874, and landscapes depicting places in or near Moret-sur-Loing. The notable paintings of the Seine and its bridges in the former suburbs of Paris are like many of his landscapes, characterized by tranquillity, in pale shades of green, pink, purple, dusty blue and cream. Over the years Sisley's power of expression and colour intensity increased.[1]	alfred sisley ˈsɪsli french sislɛ october january was an impressionist landscape painter who was born and spent most of his life in france but retained british citizenship he was the most consistent of the impressionists in his dedication to painting landscape en plein air i e outdoors he deviated into figure painting only rarely and unlike renoir and pissarro found that impressionism fulfilled his artistic needs among his important works are a series of paintings of the river thames mostly around hampton court executed in and landscapes depicting places in or near moret sur loing the notable paintings of the seine and its bridges in the former suburbs of paris are like many of his landscapes characterized by tranquillity in pale shades of green pink purple dusty blue and cream over the years sisley s power of expression and colour intensity increased

Countries	Azerbaijan	Azerbaijan (UK: /ˌæzərbaɪˈdʒɑːn, -ˈʒɑːn/ (listen), US: /ˌɑːzərbaɪˈdʒɑːn, ˌæz-/;[9] Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan [ɑːzæɾbɑjˈd͡ʒɑn]), officially the Republic of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan Respublikası [ɑːzæɾbɑjˈd͡ʒɑn ɾespublikɑˈsɯ]), is a country in the Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Western Asia,[10] it is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, the Russian republic of Dagestan to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia and Turkey to the west, and Iran to the south. The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic proclaimed its independence from the Russian Empire in 1918 and became the first secular democratic Muslim-majority state. In 1920, the country was incorporated into the Soviet Union as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic.[11][12] The modern Republic of Azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on 30 August 1991,[13] shortly before the dissolution of the USSR in the same year. In September 1991, the Armenian majority of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region seceded to form the Republic of Artsakh.[14] The region and seven surrounding districts, internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan pending a solution to the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh through negotiations facilitated by the OSCE, became de facto independent with the end of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994.[15][16][17][18] Following the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, the seven districts and parts of Nagorno-Karabakh were returned to Azerbaijani control.[19] Azerbaijan is a unitary semi-presidential[4] republic. It is one of six independent Turkic states and an active member of the Turkic Council and the TÜRKSOY community. Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 182 countries and holds membership in 38 international organizations,[20] including the United Nations (since 1992), the Council of Europe, the Non-Aligned Movement, the OSCE, and the NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) program. It is one of the founding members of GUAM, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)[21] and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Azerbaijan also holds observer status in the World Trade Organization.[20][22] While around 97% of the population is Muslim,[23] the Constitution of Azerbaijan does not declare an official religion and all major political forces in the country are secularist. Azerbaijan is a developing country and ranks 87th on the Human Development Index.[24] It has a high rate of economic development[25] and literacy,[26] as well as a low rate of unemployment.[27] However, the ruling party, the New Azerbaijan Party, in power since 1993, has been accused of authoritarian leadership and the deterioration of the country's human rights record, including increasing restrictions on civil liberties, particularly on press freedom and political repression.[28]	azerbaijan uk ˌæzərbaɪˈdʒɑːn ˈʒɑːn listen us ˌɑːzərbaɪˈdʒɑːn ˌæz azerbaijani azərbaycan ɑːzæɾbɑjˈd ʒɑn officially the republic of azerbaijan azerbaijani azərbaycan respublikası ɑːzæɾbɑjˈd ʒɑn ɾespublikɑˈsɯ is a country in the caucasus region of eurasia located at the crossroads of eastern europe and western asia it is bounded by the caspian sea to the east the russian republic of dagestan to the north georgia to the northwest armenia and turkey to the west and iran to the south the azerbaijan democratic republic proclaimed its independence from the russian empire in and became the first secular democratic muslim majority state in the country was incorporated into the soviet union as the azerbaijan soviet socialist republic the modern republic of azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on august shortly before the dissolution of the ussr in the same year in september the armenian majority of the disputed nagorno karabakh region seceded to form the republic of artsakh the region and seven surrounding districts internationally recognized as part of azerbaijan pending a solution to the status of the nagorno karabakh through negotiations facilitated by the osce became de facto independent with the end of the first nagorno karabakh war in following the nagorno karabakh war the seven districts and parts of nagorno karabakh were returned to azerbaijani control azerbaijan is a unitary semi presidential republic it is one of six independent turkic states and an active member of the turkic council and the türksoy community azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with countries and holds membership in international organizations including the united nations since the council of europe the non aligned movement the osce and the nato partnership for peace pfp program it is one of the founding members of guam the commonwealth of independent states cis and the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons azerbaijan also holds observer status in the world trade organization while around of the population is muslim the constitution of azerbaijan does not declare an official religion and all major political forces in the country are secularist azerbaijan is a developing country and ranks on the human development index it has a high rate of economic development and literacy as well as a low rate of unemployment however the ruling party the new azerbaijan party in power since has been accused of authoritarian leadership and the deterioration of the country s human rights record including increasing restrictions on civil liberties particularly on press freedom and political repression
Countries	Bangladesh	Bangladesh (/ˌbæŋləˈdɛʃ/,[16] Bengali: বাংলাদেশ, pronounced [ˈbaŋlaˌdeʃ] (listen)), officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia. It is the eighth-most populous country in the world, with a population exceeding 164 million people.[17] In terms of landmass, Bangladesh ranks 92nd, spanning 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi), making it one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the west, north, and east, Myanmar to the southeast, and the Bay of Bengal to the south. It is narrowly separated from Nepal and Bhutan by the Siliguri Corridor, and from China by Sikkim, in the north, respectively. Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation's economic, political and cultural hub. Chittagong, the largest seaport, is the second-largest city. Bangladesh forms the larger and eastern part of the Bengal region.[18] According to the ancient Indian texts, Rāmāyana and Mahābhārata, the Vanga Kingdom, one of the namesakes of the Bengal region, was a strong naval power. In the ancient and classical periods of the Indian subcontinent, the territory was home to many principalities, including the Pundra, Gangaridai, Gauda, Samatata, and Harikela. It was also a Mauryan province under the reign of Ashoka. The principalities were notable for their overseas trade, contacts with the Roman world, the export of fine muslin and silk to the Middle East, and spreading of philosophy and art to Southeast Asia. The Pala Empire, the Chandra dynasty, and the Sena dynasty were the last pre-Islamic Bengali middle kingdoms. Islam was introduced during the Pala Empire, through trade with the Abbāsid Caliphate,[19] but following the Ghurid conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji and the subsequent establishment of the Delhi Sultanate and preaching of Shah Jalāl in North Eastern Bengal, the Islamic faith spread across the entire region. In 1576, the wealthy Bengal Sultanate was absorbed into the Mughal Empire, but its rule was briefly interrupted by the Suri Empire. Following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir in the early 1700s, proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal. The region was later conquered by the British East India Company at the Battle of Plassey in 1757.[20] The borders of modern Bangladesh were established with the partition of Bengal in August 1947 at the time of partition of India, when the region became East Pakistan as a part of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan.[21] Later the rise of a pro-democracy movement thrived on Bengali nationalism and self-determination, leading to the Liberation War and eventually resulted in the emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign and independent nation in 1971. Bangladesh is the only country in the world that was created on the basis of language and ethnicity.[22][23] The Bengalis make up 98% of the total population of Bangladesh,[3][4] making it one of the most ethnically homogeneous states in the world.[24][25] The large Muslim population of Bangladesh makes it the third-largest Muslim-majority country.[26] The constitution declares Bangladesh a secular state, while establishing Islam as a state religion.[27] As a middle power in world politics,[28] Bangladesh is a unitary parliamentary democracy and constitutional republic following the Westminster system of governance. The country is divided into eight administrative divisions and sixty-four districts. Although the country continues to face the challenges of the Rohingya refugee crisis,[29] corruption,[30] and the adverse effects of climate change,[31] Bangladesh is one of the emerging and growth-leading economies of the world, and is also one of the Next Eleven countries, with one of the fastest real GDP growth rates. The Bangladeshi economy is the 39th-largest in the world by nominal GDP, and the 29th-largest by PPP.	bangladesh ˌbæŋləˈdɛʃ bengali ব ল দ শ pronounced ˈbaŋlaˌdeʃ listen officially the people s republic of bangladesh is a country in south asia it is the eighth most populous country in the world with a population exceeding million people in terms of landmass bangladesh ranks spanning square kilometres sq mi making it one of the most densely populated countries in the world bangladesh shares land borders with india to the west north and east myanmar to the southeast and the bay of bengal to the south it is narrowly separated from nepal and bhutan by the siliguri corridor and from china by sikkim in the north respectively dhaka the capital and largest city is the nation s economic political and cultural hub chittagong the largest seaport is the second largest city bangladesh forms the larger and eastern part of the bengal region according to the ancient indian texts rāmāyana and mahābhārata the vanga kingdom one of the namesakes of the bengal region was a strong naval power in the ancient and classical periods of the indian subcontinent the territory was home to many principalities including the pundra gangaridai gauda samatata and harikela it was also a mauryan province under the reign of ashoka the principalities were notable for their overseas trade contacts with the roman world the export of fine muslin and silk to the middle east and spreading of philosophy and art to southeast asia the pala empire the chandra dynasty and the sena dynasty were the last pre islamic bengali middle kingdoms islam was introduced during the pala empire through trade with the abbāsid caliphate but following the ghurid conquests led by bakhtiyar khalji and the subsequent establishment of the delhi sultanate and preaching of shah jalāl in north eastern bengal the islamic faith spread across the entire region in the wealthy bengal sultanate was absorbed into the mughal empire but its rule was briefly interrupted by the suri empire following the death of emperor aurangzeb alamgir in the early proto industrialised mughal bengal became a semi independent state under the nawabs of bengal the region was later conquered by the british east india company at the battle of plassey in the borders of modern bangladesh were established with the partition of bengal in august at the time of partition of india when the region became east pakistan as a part of the newly formed dominion of pakistan later the rise of a pro democracy movement thrived on bengali nationalism and self determination leading to the liberation war and eventually resulted in the emergence of bangladesh as a sovereign and independent nation in bangladesh is the only country in the world that was created on the basis of language and ethnicity the bengalis make up of the total population of bangladesh making it one of the most ethnically homogeneous states in the world the large muslim population of bangladesh makes it the third largest muslim majority country the constitution declares bangladesh a secular state while establishing islam as a state religion as a middle power in world politics bangladesh is a unitary parliamentary democracy and constitutional republic following the westminster system of governance the country is divided into eight administrative divisions and sixty four districts although the country continues to face the challenges of the rohingya refugee crisis corruption and the adverse effects of climate change bangladesh is one of the emerging and growth leading economies of the world and is also one of the next eleven countries with one of the fastest real gdp growth rates the bangladeshi economy is the largest in the world by nominal gdp and the largest by ppp
Countries	Belarus	Belarus,[a] officially the Republic of Belarus,[b] is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe. It is bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the northwest. Belarus covers an area of 207,600 square kilometres (80,200 sq mi), with a population of 9.4 million, and is the thirteenth-largest and the twentieth-most populous country in Europe. The country is administratively divided into seven regions, and is one of the world's most urbanized, with over 40% of its total land area forested. Minsk is the country's capital and largest city. Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including Kievan Rus', the Principality of Polotsk, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution in 1917, different states arose competing for legitimacy amidst the Civil War, ultimately ending in the rise of the Byelorussian SSR, which became a founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922. After the Polish-Soviet War, Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland. Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939, when some lands of the Second Polish Republic were reintegrated into it after the Soviet invasion of Poland, and were finalized after World War II.[12][13][14] During WWII, military operations devastated Belarus, which lost about a quarter of its population and half of its economic resources.[15] The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years. In 1945, the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the United Nations, along with the Soviet Union. The parliament of the republic proclaimed the sovereignty of Belarus on 27 July 1990, and during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Belarus declared independence on 25 August 1991.[16] Following the adoption of a new constitution in 1994, Alexander Lukashenko was elected Belarus's first president in the country's first and only free election post-independence, serving as president ever since.[17] Lukashenko openly acknowledges his style of governance as authoritarian and human rights groups consider human rights in the country to be poor.[18] Belarus is the only country in Europe officially using the death penalty. Lukashenko continued a number of Soviet-era policies, such as state ownership of large sections of the economy. In 2000, Belarus and Russia signed a treaty for greater cooperation, forming the Union State.  Belarus is a developing country ranking very high in the Human Development Index. It has been a member of the United Nations since its founding; and a member of the CIS, the CSTO, the EAEU, and the Non-Aligned Movement, it has shown no aspirations for joining the European Union but nevertheless maintains a bilateral relationship with the Union, and likewise participates in two EU projects: the Eastern Partnership and the Baku Initiative.	belarus a officially the republic of belarus b is a landlocked country in eastern europe it is bordered by russia to the east and northeast ukraine to the south poland to the west and lithuania and latvia to the northwest belarus covers an area of square kilometres sq mi with a population of million and is the thirteenth largest and the twentieth most populous country in europe the country is administratively divided into seven regions and is one of the world s most urbanized with over of its total land area forested minsk is the country s capital and largest city until the century different states at various times controlled the lands of modern day belarus including kievan rus the principality of polotsk the grand duchy of lithuania the polish lithuanian commonwealth and the russian empire in the aftermath of the russian revolution in different states arose competing for legitimacy amidst the civil war ultimately ending in the rise of the byelorussian ssr which became a founding constituent republic of the soviet union in after the polish soviet war belarus lost almost half of its territory to poland much of the borders of belarus took their modern shape in when some lands of the second polish republic were reintegrated into it after the soviet invasion of poland and were finalized after world war ii during wwii military operations devastated belarus which lost about a quarter of its population and half of its economic resources the republic was redeveloped in the post war years in the byelorussian ssr became a founding member of the united nations along with the soviet union the parliament of the republic proclaimed the sovereignty of belarus on july and during the dissolution of the soviet union belarus declared independence on august following the adoption of a new constitution in alexander lukashenko was elected belarus s first president in the country s first and only free election post independence serving as president ever since lukashenko openly acknowledges his style of governance as authoritarian and human rights groups consider human rights in the country to be poor belarus is the only country in europe officially using the death penalty lukashenko continued a number of soviet era policies such as state ownership of large sections of the economy in belarus and russia signed a treaty for greater cooperation forming the union state belarus is a developing country ranking very high in the human development index it has been a member of the united nations since its founding and a member of the cis the csto the eaeu and the non aligned movement it has shown no aspirations for joining the european union but nevertheless maintains a bilateral relationship with the union and likewise participates in two eu projects the eastern partnership and the baku initiative

Countries	Brazil	Brazil (Portuguese: Brasil; Brazilian Portuguese: [bɾaˈziw]),[nt 4] officially the Federative Republic of Brazil (Portuguese: República Federativa do Brasil),[11] is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. At 8.5 million square kilometers (3.2 million square miles)[12] and with over 211 million people, Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country by area and the sixth most populous. Its capital is Brasília, and its most populous city is São Paulo. The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states and the Federal District. It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas;[13][14] it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world;[15] as well as the most populous Roman Catholic-majority country. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers (4,655 mi).[16] It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area.[17] Its Amazon basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats.[16] This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest, environmental degradation through processes like deforestation has direct impacts on global issues like climate change and biodiversity loss. Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral, who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire. Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the National Congress. The country became a presidential republic in 1889 following a military coup d'état. An authoritarian military junta came to power in 1964 and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. Brazil's current constitution, formulated in 1988, defines it as a democratic federal republic.[18] Due to its rich culture and history, the country ranks thirteenth in the world by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[19] Brazil is classified as an upper-middle income economy by the World Bank[20] and a newly industrialized country,[21] with the largest share of global wealth in Latin America. It is considered an advanced emerging economy,[22] having the twelfth largest GDP in the world by nominal, and eighth by PPP measures.[23][24] It is one of the world's major breadbaskets, being the largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years.[25] Brazil is a regional power and sometimes considered a great[26][27][28] or a middle power in international affairs.[28][29][30][31][32][27] On account of its international recognition and influence, the country is subsequently classified as an emerging power[33] and a potential superpower by several analysts.[34][35][36] Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, BRICS, Mercosul, Organization of American States, Organization of Ibero-American States and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries.	brazil portuguese brasil brazilian portuguese bɾaˈziw nt officially the federative republic of brazil portuguese república federativa do brasil is the largest country in both south america and latin america at million square kilometers million square miles and with over million people brazil is the world s fifth largest country by area and the sixth most populous its capital is brasília and its most populous city is são paulo the federation is composed of the union of the states and the federal district it is the largest country to have portuguese as an official language and the only one in the americas it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world as well as the most populous roman catholic majority country bounded by the atlantic ocean on the east brazil has a coastline of kilometers mi it borders all other countries in south america except ecuador and chile and covers of the continent s land area its amazon basin includes a vast tropical forest home to diverse wildlife a variety of ecological systems and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats this unique environmental heritage makes brazil one of megadiverse countries and is the subject of significant global interest environmental degradation through processes like deforestation has direct impacts on global issues like climate change and biodiversity loss brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in of explorer pedro álvares cabral who claimed the area for the portuguese empire brazil remained a portuguese colony until when the capital of the empire was transferred from lisbon to rio de janeiro in the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the united kingdom of portugal brazil and the algarves independence was achieved in with the creation of the empire of brazil a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system the ratification of the first constitution in led to the formation of a bicameral legislature now called the national congress the country became a presidential republic in following a military coup d état an authoritarian military junta came to power in and ruled until after which civilian governance resumed brazil s current constitution formulated in defines it as a democratic federal republic due to its rich culture and history the country ranks thirteenth in the world by number of unesco world heritage sites brazil is classified as an upper middle income economy by the world bank and a newly industrialized country with the largest share of global wealth in latin america it is considered an advanced emerging economy having the twelfth largest gdp in the world by nominal and eighth by ppp measures it is one of the world s major breadbaskets being the largest producer of coffee for the last years brazil is a regional power and sometimes considered a great or a middle power in international affairs on account of its international recognition and influence the country is subsequently classified as an emerging power and a potential superpower by several analysts brazil is a founding member of the united nations the brics mercosul organization of american states organization of ibero american states and the community of portuguese language countries
Countries	Bulgaria	Bulgaria (/bʌlˈɡɛəriə, bʊl-/ (listen); Bulgarian: България, romanized: Balgariya), officially the Republic of Bulgaria (Bulgarian: Република България, romanized: Republika Balgariya, IPA: [rɛˈpublikɐ bɐɫˈɡarijɐ]), is a country in Southeast Europe. It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and North Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. The capital and largest city is Sofia; other major cities are Plovdiv, Varna and Burgas. With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855 sq mi), Bulgaria is Europe's sixteenth-largest country. One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture, which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for ancient Thracians, Persians, Celts and Macedonians; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45. The Eastern Roman Empire lost some of these territories to the numerous early Slavs. They were invaded by small number of warlike Bulgars in the late 7th century who subdued the Slavs and founded there the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681. It dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script. This state lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it. A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire, which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria (1218–1241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the empire disintegrated in 1396 and fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 resulted in the formation of the third and current Bulgarian state. Many ethnic Bulgarians were left outside the new nation's borders, which stoked irredentist sentiments that led to several conflicts with its neighbours and alliances with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria came under the Soviet-led Eastern Bloc and became a one-party socialist state. The ruling Communist Party gave up its monopoly on power after the revolutions of 1989 and allowed multiparty elections. Bulgaria then transitioned into a democracy and a market-based economy. Since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, Bulgaria has been a unitary parliamentary republic composed of 28 provinces, with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. Bulgaria is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the Council of Europe; it is a founding state of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and has taken a seat on the United Nations Security Council three times. Its market economy is part of the European Single Market and mostly relies on services, followed by industry—especially machine building and mining—and agriculture. Bulgaria is a developing country with an upper-middle-income economy, very high Human Development Index; although it has the lowest GDP per capita and joint-lowest Human Development Index in the European Union. Widespread corruption is a major socioeconomic issue; Bulgaria ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union in 2018.[9] The country also faces a demographic crisis, with its population shrinking annually since the late 1980s; it currently numbers roughly seven million, down from a peak of nearly nine million in 1988.	bulgaria bʌlˈɡɛəriə bʊl listen bulgarian българия romanized balgariya officially the republic of bulgaria bulgarian република българия romanized republika balgariya ipa rɛˈpublikɐ bɐɫˈɡarijɐ is a country in southeast europe it is bordered by romania to the north serbia and north macedonia to the west greece and turkey to the south and the black sea to the east the capital and largest city is sofia other major cities are plovdiv varna and burgas with a territory of square kilometres sq mi bulgaria is europe s sixteenth largest country one of the earliest societies in the lands of modern day bulgaria was the neolithic karanovo culture which dates back to bc in the to century bc the region was a battleground for ancient thracians persians celts and macedonians stability came when the roman empire conquered the region in ad the eastern roman empire lost some of these territories to the numerous early slavs they were invaded by small number of warlike bulgars in the late century who subdued the slavs and founded there the first bulgarian empire in ad it dominated most of the balkans and significantly influenced slavic cultures by developing the cyrillic script this state lasted until the early century when byzantine emperor basil ii conquered and dismantled it a successful bulgarian revolt in established a second bulgarian empire which reached its apex under ivan asen ii of bulgaria after numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife the empire disintegrated in and fell under ottoman rule for nearly five centuries the russo turkish war of resulted in the formation of the third and current bulgarian state many ethnic bulgarians were left outside the new nation s borders which stoked irredentist sentiments that led to several conflicts with its neighbours and alliances with germany in both world wars in bulgaria came under the soviet led eastern bloc and became a one party socialist state the ruling communist party gave up its monopoly on power after the revolutions of and allowed multiparty elections bulgaria then transitioned into a democracy and a market based economy since adopting a democratic constitution in bulgaria has been a unitary parliamentary republic composed of provinces with a high degree of political administrative and economic centralisation bulgaria is a member of the european union nato and the council of europe it is a founding state of the organization for security and co operation in europe osce and has taken a seat on the united nations security council three times its market economy is part of the european single market and mostly relies on services followed by industry especially machine building and mining and agriculture bulgaria is a developing country with an upper middle income economy very high human development index although it has the lowest gdp per capita and joint lowest human development index in the european union widespread corruption is a major socioeconomic issue bulgaria ranked as the most corrupt country in the european union in the country also faces a demographic crisis with its population shrinking annually since the late it currently numbers roughly seven million down from a peak of nearly nine million in
Countries	Switzerland	"Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a country situated at the confluence of Western, Central, and Southern Europe.[note 4][13] It is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons, with federal authorities based in Bern.[note 1][2][1] Switzerland is a landlocked country bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. It is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps, and the Jura, spanning a total area of 41,285 km2 (15,940 sq mi), and land area of 39,997 km2 (15,443 sq mi). While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately 8.5 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities and economic centres are located, among them Zürich, Geneva and Basel. These cities are home to several offices of international organisations such as the headquarters of FIFA, the UN's second-largest Office, and the main building of the Bank for International Settlements. The main international airports of Switzerland are also located in these cities. The establishment of the Old Swiss Confederacy dates to the late medieval period, resulting from a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy. Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognized in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which is celebrated on Swiss National Day. Since the Reformation of the 16th century, Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality; it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002. Nevertheless, it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world.[14] Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross, one of the world's oldest and best known humanitarian organisations, and is home to numerous international organisations, including the United Nations Office at Geneva, which is its second-largest in the world. It is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association, but notably not part of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Eurozone. However, it participates in the Schengen Area and the European Single Market through bilateral treaties. Switzerland occupies the crossroads of Germanic and Romance Europe, as reflected in its four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and Romansh. Although the majority of the population are German-speaking, Swiss national identity is rooted in a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy,[15] and Alpine symbolism.[16][17] Due to its linguistic diversity, Switzerland is known by a variety of native names: Schweiz [ˈʃvaɪts] (German);[note 5] Suisse [sɥis(ə)] (French); Svizzera [ˈzvittsera] (Italian); and Svizra [ˈʒviːtsrɐ, ˈʒviːtsʁɐ] (Romansh).[note 6] On coins and stamps, the Latin name, Confoederatio Helvetica – frequently shortened to ""Helvetia"" – is used instead of the four national languages. A developed country, it has the highest nominal wealth per adult[18] and the eighth-highest per capita gross domestic product, and has been considered a tax haven.[19][20] It ranks highly on some international metrics, including economic competitiveness and human development. Its cities such as Zürich, Geneva and Basel rank among the highest in the world in terms of quality of life,[21][22] albeit with some of the highest costs of living in the world.[23] In 2019, IMD placed Switzerland first in attracting skilled workers.[24] The World Economic Forum ranks it the 5th most competitive country globally.[25]"	switzerland officially the swiss confederation is a country situated at the confluence of western central and southern europe note it is a federal republic composed of cantons with federal authorities based in bern note switzerland is a landlocked country bordered by italy to the south france to the west germany to the north and austria and liechtenstein to the east it is geographically divided among the swiss plateau the alps and the jura spanning a total area of sq mi and land area of sq mi while the alps occupy the greater part of the territory the swiss population of approximately million is concentrated mostly on the plateau where the largest cities and economic centres are located among them zürich geneva and basel these cities are home to several offices of international organisations such as the headquarters of fifa the un s second largest office and the main building of the bank for international settlements the main international airports of switzerland are also located in these cities the establishment of the old swiss confederacy dates to the late medieval period resulting from a series of military successes against austria and burgundy swiss independence from the holy roman empire was formally recognized in the peace of westphalia in the federal charter of is considered the founding document of switzerland which is celebrated on swiss national day since the reformation of the century switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality it has not fought an international war since and did not join the united nations until nevertheless it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace building processes around the world switzerland is the birthplace of the red cross one of the world s oldest and best known humanitarian organisations and is home to numerous international organisations including the united nations office at geneva which is its second largest in the world it is a founding member of the european free trade association but notably not part of the european union the european economic area or the eurozone however it participates in the schengen area and the european single market through bilateral treaties switzerland occupies the crossroads of germanic and romance europe as reflected in its four main linguistic and cultural regions german french italian and romansh although the majority of the population are german speaking swiss national identity is rooted in a common historical background shared values such as federalism and direct democracy and alpine symbolism due to its linguistic diversity switzerland is known by a variety of native names schweiz ˈʃvaɪts german note suisse sɥis ə french svizzera ˈzvittsera italian and svizra ˈʒviːtsrɐ ˈʒviːtsʁɐ romansh note on coins and stamps the latin name confoederatio helvetica frequently shortened to helvetia is used instead of the four national languages a developed country it has the highest nominal wealth per adult and the eighth highest per capita gross domestic product and has been considered a tax haven it ranks highly on some international metrics including economic competitiveness and human development its cities such as zürich geneva and basel rank among the highest in the world in terms of quality of life albeit with some of the highest costs of living in the world in imd placed switzerland first in attracting skilled workers the world economic forum ranks it the most competitive country globally
Countries	Italy	Italy (Italian: Italia [iˈtaːlja] (listen)), officially the Italian Republic (Italian: Repubblica Italiana [reˈpubːlika itaˈljaːna]),[13][14][15][16] is a country consisting of a peninsula delimited by the Alps and several islands surrounding it. Italy is located in South-Central Europe,[17][18] and is considered part of Western Europe.[19][20] A unitary parliamentary republic with Rome as its capital, the country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 (116,350 sq mi) and shares land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino. Italy has a territorial enclave in Switzerland (Campione) and a maritime exclave in Tunisian waters (Lampedusa). With around 60 million inhabitants, Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union. Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures. In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy, the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name, beginning from the classical era, Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy,[21] Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy, while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively. An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC, which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People. The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula, eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe, North Africa and Asia. By the first century BC, the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural, political and religious centre, inaugurating the Pax Romana, a period of more than 200 years during which Italy's law, technology, economy, art, and literature developed.[22][23] Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire, whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture, governments, Christianity and the Latin script. During the Early Middle Ages, Italy endured the fall of the Western Roman Empire and barbarian invasions, but by the 11th century numerous rival city-states and maritime republics, mainly in the northern and central regions of Italy, rose to great prosperity through trade, commerce and banking, laying the groundwork for modern capitalism.[24] These mostly independent statelets served as Europe's main trading hubs with Asia and the Near East, often enjoying a greater degree of democracy than the larger feudal monarchies that were consolidating throughout Europe; however, part of central Italy was under the control of the theocratic Papal States, while Southern Italy remained largely feudal until the 19th century, partially as a result of a succession of Byzantine, Arab, Norman, Angevin, Aragonese and other foreign conquests of the region.[25] The Renaissance began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a renewed interest in humanism, science, exploration and art. Italian culture flourished, producing famous scholars, artists and polymaths. During the Middle Ages, Italian explorers discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World, helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery. Nevertheless, Italy's commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of trade routes that bypassed the Mediterranean.[26] Centuries of foreign meddling and conquest and the rivalry and infighting between the Italian city-states, such as the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries, left Italy politically fragmented, and it was further conquered and divided among multiple foreign European powers over the centuries. By the mid-19th century, rising Italian nationalism and calls for independence from foreign control led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval. After centuries of foreign domination and political division, Italy was almost entirely unified in 1861, establishing the Kingdom of Italy as a great power.[27] From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, Italy rapidly industrialised, mainly in the north, and acquired a colonial empire,[28] while the south remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation, fuelling a large and influential diaspora.[29] Despite being one of the four main allied powers in World War I, Italy entered a period of economic crisis and social turmoil, leading to the rise of the Italian fascist dictatorship in 1922. Participation in World War II on the Axis side ended in military defeat, economic destruction and the Italian Civil War. Following the liberation of Italy and the rise of the Italian Resistance, the country abolished their monarchy, established a democratic Republic, enjoyed a prolonged economic boom, and became a highly developed country. The Italian border that applies today has existed since 1975, when Trieste was formally annexed to Italy.[30] Today, Italy is considered to be one of the world's most culturally and economically advanced countries,[30][31][32] with the world's eighth-largest economy by nominal GDP (third in the European Union), sixth-largest national wealth and third-largest central bank gold reserve. It ranks very highly in life expectancy, quality of life,[33] healthcare,[34] and education. The country plays a prominent role in regional and global economic, military, cultural and diplomatic affairs; it is both a regional power[35][36] and a great power,[37][38] and is ranked the world's eighth most-powerful military. Italy is a founding and leading member of the European Union and a member of numerous international institutions, including the United Nations, NATO, the OECD, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the World Trade Organization, the Group of Seven, the G20, the Union for the Mediterranean, the Council of Europe, Uniting for Consensus, the Schengen Area and many more. The country has long been a global centre of art, music, literature, philosophy, science and technology, and fashion, and has greatly influenced and contributed to diverse fields including cinema, cuisine, sports, jurisprudence, banking and business.[39] As a reflection of its cultural wealth, Italy is home to the world's largest number of World Heritage Sites (55), and is the fifth-most visited country.	italy italian italia iˈtaːlja listen officially the italian republic italian repubblica italiana reˈpubːlika itaˈljaːna is a country consisting of a peninsula delimited by the alps

Countries	Israel	"Israel (/ˈɪzriəl, ˈɪzreɪəl/; Hebrew: יִשְׂרָאֵל‎; Arabic: إِسْرَائِيل‎), officially known as the State of Israel (Hebrew: מְדִינַת יִשְׂרָאֵל‎, Medinat Yisra'el), is a country in Western Asia, located on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to the east and west,[22] respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. Israel's economic and technological center is Tel Aviv,[23] while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although international recognition of the state's sovereignty over Jerusalem is limited.[24][25][26][27][fn 4] Israel has evidence of the earliest migration of hominids out of Africa.[28] Canaanite tribes are archaeologically attested since the Middle Bronze Age,[29][30] while the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah emerged during the Iron Age.[31][32] The Neo-Assyrian Empire destroyed Israel around 720 BCE.[33] Judah was later conquered by the Babylonian, Persian and Hellenistic empires and had existed as Jewish autonomous provinces.[34][35] The successful Maccabean Revolt led to an independent Hasmonean kingdom by 110 BCE,[36] which in 63 BCE however became a client state of the Roman Republic that subsequently installed the Herodian dynasty in 37 BCE, and in 6 CE created the Roman province of Judea.[37] Judea lasted as a Roman province until the failed Jewish revolts resulted in widespread destruction,[36] the expulsion of the Jewish population[36][38] and the renaming of the region from Iudaea to Syria Palaestina.[39] Jewish presence in the region has persisted to a certain extent over the centuries. In the 7th century CE, the Levant was taken from the Byzantine Empire by the Arabs and remained in Muslim control until the First Crusade of 1099, followed by the Ayyubid conquest of 1187. The Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt extended its control over the Levant in the 13th century until its defeat by the Ottoman Empire in 1517. During the 19th century, national awakening among Jews led to the establishment of the Zionist movement followed by immigration to Palestine. During the first half of the 20th century, the land was controlled as a mandate of the British Empire from 1920-1948, having been ceded by the Ottomans at the end of the First World War.  Not long after, the Second World War saw the mandate bombed heavily and Yishuv Jews serve for the Allies, after the British agreed to supply arms and form a Jewish Brigade in 1944.  Amidst growing tension and with the British eager to appease both Arab and Jewish factions, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947 recommending the creation of independent Arab and Jewish states and an internationalized Jerusalem.[40] The plan was accepted by the Jewish Agency, and rejected by Arab leaders.[41][42][43] The following year, the Jewish Agency declared the independence of the State of Israel, and the subsequent 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw Israel's establishment over most of the former Mandate territory, while the West Bank and Gaza were held by neighboring Arab states.[44] Israel has since fought several wars with Arab countries,[45] and since the Six-Day War in June 1967 held occupied territories including the West Bank, Golan Heights and the Gaza Strip (still considered occupied after the 2005 disengagement, although some legal experts dispute this claim).[46][47][48][fn 5] Subsequent legislative acts have resulted in the full application of Israeli law within the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, as well as its partial application in the West Bank via ""pipelining"" into Israeli settlements.[49][50][51][52] Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is internationally considered to be the world's longest military occupation in modern times.[fn 5][56] Efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have not resulted in a final peace agreement, while Israel has signed peace treaties with both Egypt and Jordan. In its Basic Laws, Israel defines itself as a Jewish and democratic state and the nation state of the Jewish people.[57] The country is a liberal democracy with a parliamentary system, proportional representation, and universal suffrage.[58][59] The prime minister is head of government and the Knesset is the legislature. With a population of around 9 million as of 2019,[60] Israel is a developed country and an OECD member.[61] It has the world's 31st-largest economy by nominal GDP, and is the most developed country currently in conflict.[62] It has the highest standard of living in the Middle East,[21] and ranks among the world's top countries by percentage of citizens with military training,[63] percentage of citizens holding a tertiary education degree,[64] research and development spending by GDP percentage,[65] women's safety,[66] life expectancy,[67] innovativeness,[68] and happiness.[69]"	israel

Countries	Poland	Poland (Polish: Polska [ˈpɔlska] (listen)), officially the Republic of Poland (Polish: Rzeczpospolita Polska[c] [ʐɛt͡ʂpɔˈspɔlita ˈpɔlska] (listen)), is a country located in Central Europe.[14] It is divided into 16 administrative provinces, covering an area of 312,696 square kilometres (120,733 sq mi), and has a largely temperate seasonal climate.[8] With a population of nearly 38.5 million people, Poland is the fifth most populous member state of the European Union.[8] Poland's capital and largest metropolis is Warsaw. Other major cities include Kraków, Łódź, Wrocław, Poznań, Gdańsk, and Szczecin. Poland's topographically diverse territory extends from the beaches along the Baltic Sea in the north to the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains in its south. The country is bordered by Lithuania and Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast to the northeast, Belarus and Ukraine to the east, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south, and Germany to the west.[15] The history of human activity on Polish soil spans thousands of years. Throughout the late antiquity period it became extensively diverse, with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast Central European Plain. However, it was the Western Polans who dominated the region and gave Poland its name. The establishment of Polish statehood can be traced to 966, when the pagan ruler of a realm coextensive with the territory of present-day Poland embraced Christianity and converted to Catholicism.[16] The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025, and in 1569 it cemented its longstanding political association with Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin. This union formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, one of the largest (over 1,000,000 square kilometres – 400,000 square miles) and most populous nations of 16th and 17th century Europe, with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted Europe's first modern constitution, the Constitution of 3 May 1791.[17][18][19] With the passing of prominence and prosperity, the country was partitioned by neighbouring states at the end of the 18th century, and regained independence in 1918 with the Treaty of Versailles. After a series of territorial conflicts, the new multi-ethnic Poland restored its position as a key player in European politics. In September 1939, World War II began with the invasion of Poland by Germany, followed by the Soviets invading Poland in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Approximately six million Polish citizens, including three million of the country's Jews, perished during the course of the war.[20][21] As a member of the Eastern Bloc, the Polish People's Republic proclaimed forthwith was a chief signatory of the Warsaw Treaty amidst global Cold War tensions. In the wake of the 1989 events, notably through the emergence and contributions of the Solidarity movement, the communist government was dissolved and Poland re-established itself as a semi-presidential democratic republic. Poland is a developed market[22] and a regional power in Central Europe;[23][24] it has the sixth largest economy in the European Union by nominal GDP and the fifth largest by GDP (PPP).[25] It provides very high standards of living, safety[26] and economic freedom,[27][28] as well as free university education and a universal health care system in accordance with EU standards.[29][30] The country has 16 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 15 of which are cultural.[31] Poland is a member state of the Schengen Area, the United Nations, NATO, the OECD, the Three Seas Initiative and the Visegrád Group.	poland polish polska ˈpɔlska listen officially the republic of poland polish rzeczpospolita polska c ʐɛt ʂpɔˈspɔlita ˈpɔlska listen is a country located in central europe it is divided into administrative provinces covering an area of square kilometres sq mi and has a largely temperate seasonal climate with a population of nearly million people poland is the fifth most populous member state of the european union poland s capital and largest metropolis is warsaw other major cities include kraków łódź wrocław poznań gdańsk and szczecin poland s topographically diverse territory extends from the beaches along the baltic sea in the north to the sudetes and carpathian mountains in its south the country is bordered by lithuania and russia s kaliningrad oblast to the northeast belarus and ukraine to the east slovakia and the czech republic to the south and germany to the west the history of human activity on polish soil spans thousands of years throughout the late antiquity period it became extensively diverse with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast central european plain however it was the western polans who dominated the region and gave poland its name the establishment of polish statehood can be traced to when the pagan ruler of a realm coextensive with the territory of present day poland embraced christianity and converted to catholicism the kingdom of poland was founded in and in it cemented its longstanding political association with lithuania by signing the union of lublin this union formed the polish lithuanian commonwealth one of the largest over square kilometres square miles and most populous nations of and century europe with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted europe s first modern constitution the constitution of may with the passing of prominence and prosperity the country was partitioned by neighbouring states at the end of the century and regained independence in with the treaty of versailles after a series of territorial conflicts the new multi ethnic poland restored its position as a key player in european politics in september world war ii began with the invasion of poland by germany followed by the soviets invading poland in accordance with the molotov ribbentrop pact approximately six million polish citizens including three million of the country s jews perished during the course of the war as a member of the eastern bloc the polish people s republic proclaimed forthwith was a chief signatory of the warsaw treaty amidst global cold war tensions in the wake of the events notably through the emergence and contributions of the solidarity movement the communist government was dissolved and poland re established itself as a semi presidential democratic republic poland is a developed market and a regional power in central europe it has the sixth largest economy in the european union by nominal gdp and the fifth largest by gdp ppp it provides very high standards of living safety and economic freedom as well as free university education and a universal health care system in accordance with eu standards the country has unesco world heritage sites of which are cultural poland is a member state of the schengen area the united nations nato the oecd the three seas initiative and the visegrád group

Believed to have been created by Charlemagne, Andorra was ruled by the count of Urgell until 988, when it was transferred to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell. The present principality was formed by a charter in 1278. It is known as a principality as it is a diarchy headed by two princes: the Bishop of Urgell in Catalonia, Spain, and the President of the French Republic. Andorra is the sixth-smallest nation in Europe, having an area of 468 square kilometres (181 sq mi) and a population of approximately 77,006.[15][16] The Andorran people are a Romance ethnic group of originally Catalan descent.[17] Andorra is the 16th-smallest country in the world by land and the 11th-smallest by population.[18] Its capital, Andorra la Vella, is the highest capital city in Europe, at an elevation of 1,023 metres (3,356 feet) above sea level.[19] The official language is Catalan, but Spanish, Portuguese, and French are also commonly spoken.[3][20] Tourism in Andorra sees an estimated 10.2 million visitors annually.[21] Andorra is not a member of the European Union, but the euro is its official currency. It has been a member of the United Nations since 1993.[22] In 2013, Andorra had the highest life expectancy in the world at 81 years, according to the Global Burden of Disease Study.[23]	andorra ænˈdɔːrə listen also uk ænˈdɒrə catalan ənˈdorə officially the principality of andorra catalan principat d andorra is a sovereign landlocked microstate on the iberian peninsula in the eastern pyrenees bordered by france to the north and spain to the south believed to have been created by charlemagne andorra was ruled by the count of urgell until when it was transferred to the roman catholic diocese of urgell the present principality was formed by a charter in it is known as a principality as it is a diarchy headed by two princes the bishop of urgell in catalonia spain and the president of the french republic andorra is the sixth smallest nation in europe having an area of square kilometres sq mi and a population of approximately the andorran people are a romance ethnic group of originally catalan descent andorra is the smallest country in the world by land and the smallest by population its capital andorra la vella is the highest capital city in europe at an elevation of metres feet above sea level the official language is catalan but spanish portuguese and french are also commonly spoken tourism in andorra sees an estimated million visitors annually andorra is not a member of the european union but the euro is its official currency it has been a member of the united nations since in andorra had the highest life expectancy in the world at years according to the global burden of disease study
Countries	Zambia	"Zambia (/ˈzæmbiə, ˈzɑːm-/), officially the Republic of Zambia (Tonga: Cisi ca Zambia; Nyanja: Dziko la Zambia), is a landlocked country at the crossroads of Central, Southern and East Africa,[10] but it is usually considered as being in South-Central Africa[11] (although some sources consider it part of East Africa[12]). Its neighbours are the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Tanzania to the north-east, Malawi to the east, Mozambique to the southeast, Zimbabwe and Botswana to the south, Namibia to the southwest, and Angola to the west. The capital city is Lusaka, located in the south-central part of Zambia. The population is concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the Copperbelt Province to the northwest, the core economic hubs of the country. Originally inhabited by Khoisan peoples, the region was affected by the Bantu expansion of the thirteenth century. Following European explorers in the eighteenth century, the British colonised the region into the British protectorates of Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia and North-Eastern Rhodesia towards the end of the nineteenth century. These were merged in 1911 to form Northern Rhodesia. For most of the colonial period, Zambia was governed by an administration appointed from London with the advice of the British South Africa Company.[13] On 24 October 1964, Zambia became independent of the United Kingdom and prime minister Kenneth Kaunda became the inaugural president. Kaunda's socialist United National Independence Party (UNIP) maintained power from 1964 until 1991. Kaunda played a key role in regional diplomacy, cooperating closely with the United States in search of solutions to conflicts in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Angola, and Namibia.[14] From 1972 to 1991 Zambia was a one-party state with the UNIP as the sole legal political party under the motto ""One Zambia, One Nation"". Kaunda was succeeded by Frederick Chiluba of the social-democratic Movement for Multi-Party Democracy in 1991, beginning a period of social-economic growth and government decentralisation. Levy Mwanawasa, Chiluba's chosen successor, presided over Zambia from January 2002 until his death on 19 August 2008 and is credited with campaigns to reduce corruption and increase the standard of living. After Mwanawasa's death, Rupiah Banda presided as Acting President before being elected President in 2008. Holding the office for only three years, Banda stepped down after his defeat in the 2011 elections by Patriotic Front party leader Michael Sata. Sata died on 28 October 2014, making him the second Zambian president to die in office.[15] Guy Scott served briefly as interim president until new elections were held on 20 January 2015,[16] in which Edgar Lungu was elected as the sixth President. Zambia contains vast amounts of natural resources such as minerals, wildlife, forestry, freshwater and arable land.[17] In 2010, the World Bank named Zambia one of the world's fastest economically reformed countries.[18] The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) is headquartered in Lusaka."	zambia ˈzæmbiə ˈzɑːm officially the republic of zambia tonga cisi ca zambia nyanja dziko la zambia is a landlocked country at the crossroads of central southern and east africa but it is usually considered as being in south central africa although some sources consider it part of east africa its neighbours are the democratic republic of the congo to the north tanzania to the north east malawi to the east mozambique to the southeast zimbabwe and botswana to the south namibia to the southwest and angola to the west the capital city is lusaka located in the south central part of zambia the population is concentrated mainly around lusaka in the south and the copperbelt province to the northwest the core economic hubs of the country originally inhabited by khoisan peoples the region was affected by the bantu expansion of the thirteenth century following european explorers in the eighteenth century the british colonised the region into the british protectorates of barotziland north western rhodesia and north eastern rhodesia towards the end of the nineteenth century these were merged in to form northern rhodesia for most of the colonial period zambia was governed by an administration appointed from london with the advice of the british south africa company on october zambia became independent of the united kingdom and prime minister kenneth kaunda became the inaugural president kaunda s socialist united national independence party unip maintained power from until kaunda played a key role in regional diplomacy cooperating closely with the united states in search of solutions to conflicts in rhodesia zimbabwe angola and namibia from to zambia was a one party state with the unip as the sole legal political party under the motto one zambia one nation kaunda was succeeded by frederick chiluba of the social democratic movement for multi party democracy in beginning a period of social economic growth and government decentralisation levy mwanawasa chiluba s chosen successor presided over zambia from january until his death on august and is credited with campaigns to reduce corruption and increase the standard of living after mwanawasa s death rupiah banda presided as acting president before being elected president in holding the office for only three years banda stepped down after his defeat in the elections by patriotic front party leader michael sata sata died on october making him the second zambian president to die in office guy scott served briefly as interim president until new elections were held on january in which edgar lungu was elected as the sixth president zambia contains vast amounts of natural resources such as minerals wildlife forestry freshwater and arable land in the world bank named zambia one of the world s fastest economically reformed countries the common market for eastern and southern africa comesa is headquartered in lusaka
Countries	Vietnam	Vietnam (also written as Viet Nam, Vietnamese: Việt Nam, [vîət nāːm] (listen)), officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam[9] (Vietnamese: Cộng hòa Xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt Nam), is a country in Southeast Asia and the easternmost country on the Indochinese Peninsula. With an estimated 96.2 million inhabitants as of 2019, it is the 15th most populous country in the world. Vietnam shares its land borders with China to the north, and Laos and Cambodia to the west. It shares its maritime borders with Thailand through the Gulf of Thailand, and the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia through the South China Sea.[n 5] Its capital city is Hanoi, and its most populous city is Ho Chi Minh City, also known by its former name of Saigon. Archaeological excavations indicate that Vietnam was inhabited as early as the Paleolithic age. The ancient Vietnamese nation, which was centered on the Red River valley and nearby coastal areas, was annexed by the Han dynasty in the 2nd century BC, which subsequently made Vietnam a division of Imperial China for over a millennium. The first independent monarchy emerged in the 10th century AD. This paved the way for successive imperial dynasties as the nation expanded southward until the Indochina Peninsula was colonised by the French in the late 19th century. Modern Vietnam was born upon the Proclamation of Independence from France in 1945. Following Vietnamese victory against the French in the First Indochina War, which ended in 1954, the nation was divided into two rival states: communist North and anti-communist South. Conflicts intensified in the Vietnam War, which saw extensive US intervention in support of South Vietnam and ended with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. After North and South Vietnam were reunified as a communist state under a unitary socialist government in 1976, the country became economically and politically isolated until 1986, when the Communist Party initiated a series of economic and political reforms that facilitated Vietnamese integration into world politics and the global economy. As a result of the successful reforms, Vietnam has enjoyed a high GDP growth rate, consistently ranked among the fastest-growing countries in the world. It nevertheless faces challenges including corruption, pollution, poverty, inadequate social welfare and a poor human rights record, including increasing persecution of religious groups and human rights advocates and intensifying restrictions on civil liberties.[11] By 2010, Vietnam had established diplomatic relations with 178 countries. It is a member of such international organisations as the United Nations (UN), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and the World Trade Organization (WTO).	vietnam also written as viet nam vietnamese việt nam vîət nāːm listen officially the socialist republic of vietnam vietnamese cộng hòa xã hội chủ nghĩa việt nam is a country in southeast asia and the easternmost country on the indochinese peninsula with an estimated million inhabitants as of it is the most populous country in the world vietnam shares its land borders with china to the north and laos and cambodia to the west it shares its maritime borders with thailand through the gulf of thailand and the philippines indonesia and malaysia through the south china sea n its capital city is hanoi and its most populous city is ho chi minh city also known by its former name of saigon archaeological excavations indicate that vietnam was inhabited as early as the paleolithic age the ancient vietnamese nation which was centered on the red river valley and nearby coastal areas was annexed by the han dynasty in the century bc which subsequently made vietnam a division of imperial china for over a millennium the first independent monarchy emerged in the century ad this paved the way for successive imperial dynasties as the nation expanded southward until the indochina peninsula was colonised by the french in the late century modern vietnam was born upon the proclamation of independence from france in following vietnamese victory against the french in the first indochina war which ended in the nation was divided into two rival states communist north and anti communist south conflicts intensified in the vietnam war which saw extensive us intervention in support of south vietnam and ended with north vietnamese victory in after north and south vietnam were reunified as a communist state under a unitary socialist government in the country became economically and politically isolated until when the communist party initiated a series of economic and political reforms that facilitated vietnamese integration into world politics and the global economy as a result of the successful reforms vietnam has enjoyed a high gdp growth rate consistently ranked among the fastest growing countries in the world it nevertheless faces challenges including corruption pollution poverty inadequate social welfare and a poor human rights record including increasing persecution of religious groups and human rights advocates and intensifying restrictions on civil liberties by vietnam had established diplomatic relations with countries it is a member of such international organisations as the united nations un the association of southeast asian nations asean the asia pacific economic cooperation apec forum and the world trade organization wto
Countries	Australia	Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.[13] It is the largest country in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The population of 26 million[7] is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard.[14] Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest city is Sydney. The country's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide. Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years[15] prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century, who named it New Holland. In 1770, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788, a date which became Australia's national day. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades, and by the time of an 1850s gold rush, most of the continent had been explored by European settlers and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established. On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and ten territories. Australia is the oldest,[16] flattest,[17] and driest inhabited continent,[18][19] with the least fertile soils.[20][21] It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300 sq mi).[22] A megadiverse country, its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, and mountain ranges in the south-east. Australia generates its income from various sources, including mining-related exports, telecommunications, banking, manufacturing, and international education.[23][24][25] Australia is a developed country, with the world's thirteenth-largest economy and tenth-highest per capita income.[26] It is considered a regional power and has the world's thirteenth-highest military expenditure.[27] Immigrants account for 30% of the population,[28] the highest proportion in any country with a population over 10 million.[29]  The country ranks highly in measures of health, education, economic freedom, and civil liberties.[30] Australia is a member of the United Nations, G20, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, Pacific Islands Forum, and the ASEAN Plus Six.	australia officially the commonwealth of australia is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the australian continent the island of tasmania and numerous smaller islands it is the largest country in oceania and the world s sixth largest country by total area the population of million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard australia s capital is canberra and its largest city is sydney the country s other major metropolitan areas are melbourne brisbane perth and adelaide indigenous australians inhabited the continent for about years prior to the first arrival of dutch explorers in the early century who named it new holland in australia s eastern half was claimed by great britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of new south wales from january a date which became australia s national day the population grew steadily in subsequent decades and by the time of an gold rush most of the continent had been explored by european settlers and an additional five self governing crown colonies established on january the six colonies federated forming the commonwealth of australia australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy comprising six states and ten territories australia is the oldest flattest and driest inhabited continent with the least fertile soils it has a landmass of square kilometres sq mi a megadiverse country its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates with deserts in the centre tropical rainforests in the north east and mountain ranges in the south east australia generates its income from various sources including mining related exports telecommunications banking manufacturing and international education australia is a developed country with the world s thirteenth largest economy and tenth highest per capita income it is considered a regional power and has the world s thirteenth highest military expenditure immigrants account for of the population the highest proportion in any country with a population over million the country ranks highly in measures of health education economic freedom and civil liberties australia is a member of the united nations commonwealth of nations anzus organisation for economic co operation and development oecd world trade organization asia pacific economic cooperation pacific islands forum and the asean plus six
Countries	Uzbekistan	"Uzbekistan (UK: /ʊzˌbɛkɪˈstɑːn, ʌz-, -ˈstæn/, US: /ʊzˈbɛkɪstæn, -stɑːn/;[12][13] Uzbek: Oʻzbekiston, pronounced [ozbekiˈstɒn]), officially the Republic of Uzbekistan (Uzbek: Oʻzbekiston Respublikasi), is a country in Central Asia. It is surrounded by five landlocked countries: Kazakhstan to the north; Kyrgyzstan to the northeast; Tajikistan to the southeast; Afghanistan to the south and Turkmenistan to the south-west. Along with Liechtenstein, it is one of two doubly landlocked countries. As a sovereign state, Uzbekistan is a secular, unitary constitutional republic. It comprises 12 provinces (vilayats) and one autonomous republic, Karakalpakstan. The capital and largest city of Uzbekistan is Tashkent. What is now Uzbekistan was in ancient times part of the Iranian-speaking region of Transoxiana and Turan. The first recorded settlers were Eastern Iranian nomads, known as Scythians, who founded kingdoms in Khwarazm (8th–6th centuries BC), Bactria (8th–6th centuries BCE), Sogdia (8th–6th centuries BCE), Fergana (3rd century BCE – 6th century CE), and Margiana (3rd century BCE – 6th century CE). The area was incorporated into the Iranian Achaemenid Empire and, after a period of Macedonian Greek rule, was ruled by the Iranian Parthian Empire and later by the Sasanian Empire, until the Muslim conquest of Persia in the seventh century. The Early Muslim conquests converted most of the people, including the local ruling classes, into adherents of Islam. During this period, cities such as Samarkand, Khiva and Bukhara began to grow rich from the Silk Road, and witnessed the emergence of leading figures of the Islamic Golden Age, including Muhammad al-Bukhari, Al-Tirmidhi, Ismail Samani, al-Biruni, and Avicenna. The local Khwarazmian dynasty, and Central Asia as a whole, were decimated by the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. After the region became dominated by Turkic peoples. The city of Shahrisabz was the birthplace of the Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur (Tamerlane), who in the 14th century established the Timurid Empire and was proclaimed the Supreme Emir of Turan with his capital in Samarkand, which became a centre of science under the rule of Ulugh Beg, giving birth to the Timurid Renaissance. The territories of the Timurid dynasty were conquered by Uzbek Shaybanids in the 16th century, moving the centre of power to Bukhara. The region was split into three states: the Khanate of Khiva, Khanate of Kokand and Emirate of Bukhara. Conquests by Emperor Babur towards the east led the foundation of India's proto-industrialised Mughal Empire. Central Asia, bar Afghanistan, was gradually incorporated into the Russian Empire during the 19th century, with Tashkent becoming the political center of Russian Turkestan. In 1924, national delimitation meant constituent republics of the Soviet Union, here the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, was created. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it declared independence as the Republic of Uzbekistan on 31 August 1991. Uzbekistan has a diverse cultural heritage due to its layers of history and strategic location. Its official language is Uzbek, a Turkic language written in a modified Latin alphabet and spoken natively by approximately 85% of the population. Russian has widespread use as an inter-ethnic tongue (pidgen) and in governance. Uzbeks constitute 81% of the population, followed by Russians (5.4%), Tajiks (4.0%), Kazakhs (3.0%) and others (6.5%). Muslims constitute 79% of the people while 5% follow Russian Orthodox Christianity and 16% of the population follow other religions or are non-religious. A majority of Uzbeks are non-denominational Muslims.[14] Uzbekistan is a member of the CIS, OSCE, UN and the SCO. While officially a democratic republic,[15] by 2008 non-governmental human rights organisations defined Uzbekistan as ""an authoritarian state with limited civil rights"".[16] Following the death of Islam Karimov in 2016, the second president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, started a new course, which was described as a A Quiet Revolution and Revolution from Above. He stated he intended to abolish cotton slavery, systematic use of child labour,[17] and exit visas, and to introduce a tax reform and create four new free economic zones and he has amnestied some political prisoners. Relations with the neighbouring countries of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan drastically improved.[18][19][20][21] The Amnesty International report on human rights for 2017/2018 found remnant repressive measures or lack of universal rule of law, specific issues being a small minority of labour force in cotton fields being forced labour and restrictions on the movement of 'freed' prisoners. A United Nations report of 2020 found much improvement. The Uzbek economy is in a gradual transition to the market economy, with foreign trade policy being based on import substitution. In September 2017, the country's currency became fully convertible at market rates. Uzbekistan is a major producer and exporter of cotton. With the gigantic power-generation facilities of the Soviet era and an ample supply of natural gas, Uzbekistan has become the largest electricity producer in Central Asia.[22] As of late 2018, the republic was given a BB- rating by both Standard and Poor (S&P) and Fitch. Strengths indicated by Brookings Institution include Uzbekistan having large liquid assets, high economic growth and low public debt. Among the constraints holding the republic back are low GDP per capita, something the government could influence by changing how it accounts for sectors of the economy not currently included.[23]"	uzbekistan uk ʊzˌbɛkɪˈstɑːn ʌz ˈstæn us ʊzˈbɛkɪstæn stɑːn uzbek oʻzbekiston pronounced ozbekiˈstɒn officially the republic of uzbekistan uzbek oʻzbekiston respublikasi is a country in
