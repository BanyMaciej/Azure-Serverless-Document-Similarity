Animals	Tiger	The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own. The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in Western and Central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. Today's tiger range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra.  The tiger is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the populations living in small pockets isolated from each other. India currently hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict, in particular in range countries with a high human population density. The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It featured prominently in ancient mythology and folklore and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams. The tiger is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.	the tiger panthera tigris is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus panthera it is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange brown fur with a lighter underside it is an apex predator primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar it is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator requiring large contiguous areas of habitat which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years before they become independent and leave their mother s home range to establish their own the tiger once ranged widely from the eastern anatolia region in the west to the amur river basin and in the south from the foothills of the himalayas to bali in the sunda islands since the early century tiger populations have lost at least of their historic range and have been extirpated in western and central asia from the islands of java and bali and in large areas of southeast and south asia and china today s tiger range is fragmented stretching from siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the indian subcontinent and sumatra the tiger is listed as endangered on the iucn red list as of the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between and mature individuals with most of the populations living in small pockets isolated from each other india currently hosts the largest tiger population major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction habitat fragmentation and poaching tigers are also victims of human wildlife conflict in particular in range countries with a high human population density the tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world s charismatic megafauna it featured prominently in ancient mythology and folklore and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature appearing on many flags coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams the tiger is the national animal of india bangladesh malaysia and south korea
Animals	Rabbit	Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha (along with the hare and the pika).  Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds[1] of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet. With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit (or bunny) is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration. Although once considered rodents, lagomorphs like rabbits have been discovered to have diverged separately and earlier than their rodent cousins, and have a number of traits rodents lack, like two extra incisors.	rabbits are small mammals in the family leporidae of the order lagomorpha along with the hare and the pika oryctolagus cuniculus includes the european rabbit species and its descendants the world s breeds of domestic rabbit sylvilagus includes wild rabbit species among them the seven types of cottontail the european rabbit which has been introduced on every continent except antarctica is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet with its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures the rabbit or bunny is in many areas of the world a part of daily life as food clothing a companion and a source of artistic inspiration although once considered rodents lagomorphs like rabbits have been discovered to have diverged separately and earlier than their rodent cousins and have a number of traits rodents lack like two extra incisors
Animals	Koala Bear	The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear[a]  (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which are members of the family Vombatidae. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed. Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus. Koalas were hunted by Indigenous Australians and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed scientific description of the koala in 1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist John Gould illustrated and described the koala, introducing the species to the general British public. Further details about the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists. Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide as a symbol of Australia. Koalas are listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The animal was hunted heavily in the early 20th century for its fur, and large-scale cullings in Queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species. Sanctuaries were established, and translocation efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced. Among the many threats to their existence are habitat destruction caused by agriculture, urbanisation, droughts and associated bushfires, some related to climate change.	the koala or inaccurately koala bear a phascolarctos cinereus is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to australia it is the only extant representative of the family phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats which are members of the family vombatidae the koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland s eastern and southern regions inhabiting queensland new south wales victoria and south australia it is easily recognisable by its stout tailless body and large head with round fluffy ears and large spoon shaped nose the koala has a body length of cm in and weighs kg lb fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south these populations possibly are separate subspecies but this is disputed koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to hours a day they are asocial animals and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests being marsupials koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers pouches where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives these young koalas known as joeys are fully weaned around a year old koalas have few natural predators and parasites but are threatened by various pathogens such as chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus koalas were hunted by indigenous australians and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia the first recorded encounter between a european and a koala was in and an image of the animal was published in by naturalist george perry botanist robert brown wrote the first detailed scientific description of the koala in although his work remained unpublished for years popular artist john gould illustrated and described the koala introducing the species to the general british public further details about the animal s biology were revealed in the century by several english scientists because of its distinctive appearance the koala is recognised worldwide as a symbol of australia koalas are listed as a vulnerable species by the international union for conservation of nature the animal was hunted heavily in the early century for its fur and large scale cullings in queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species sanctuaries were established and translocation efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced among the many threats to their existence are habitat destruction caused by agriculture urbanisation droughts and associated bushfires some related to climate change
Animals	Guinea Pig	The  guinea pig or domestic guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), also known as cavy or domestic cavy (/ˈkeɪvi/), is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia. Despite their common name, guinea pigs are not native to Guinea, nor are they closely biologically related to pigs, and the origin of the name is still unclear. They originated in the Andes of South America. Studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy, such as C. tschudii, and do not exist naturally in the wild.[1][2] They were originally domesticated as livestock, for a source of meat, and continue to be consumed as food. In Western society, the domestic guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a pocket pet, since its introduction to Europe and North America by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature, friendly responsiveness to handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring for them have made guinea pigs a continuing popular choice of household pet. Organizations devoted to the competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide. Many specialized breeds, with varying coat colors and textures, are selected by breeders. The domestic guinea pig plays an important role in folk culture for many indigenous Andean peoples, especially as a food source. It is also used in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies.[3] The animals are used for meat and are a culinary staple in the Andes Mountains, where they are known as cuy.  In the 1960s a modern breeding program was started in Peru that resulted in large breeds known as cuy mejorados (improved cuy). Marketers tried to increase consumption of the animal outside South America.[4] Biological experimentation on domestic guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were used so frequently as model organisms in the 19th and 20th centuries that the epithet guinea pig came into use to describe a human test subject. Since that time, they have been largely replaced by other rodents, such as mice and rats. However, they are still used in research, primarily as models to study such human medical conditions as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy (like humans, they require dietary intake of vitamin C), and pregnancy complications.	the guinea pig or domestic guinea pig cavia porcellus also known as cavy or domestic cavy ˈkeɪvi is a species of rodent belonging to the family caviidae and the genus cavia despite their common name guinea pigs are not native to guinea nor are they closely biologically related to pigs and the origin of the name is still unclear they originated in the andes of south america studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as c tschudii and do not exist naturally in the wild they were originally domesticated as livestock for a source of meat and continue to be consumed as food in western society the domestic guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a pocket pet since its introduction to europe and north america by european traders in the century their docile nature friendly responsiveness to handling and feeding and the relative ease of caring for them have made guinea pigs a continuing popular choice of household pet organizations devoted to the competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide many specialized breeds with varying coat colors and textures are selected by breeders the domestic guinea pig plays an important role in folk culture for many indigenous andean peoples especially as a food source it is also used in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies the animals are used for meat and are a culinary staple in the andes mountains where they are known as cuy in the a modern breeding program was started in peru that resulted in large breeds known as cuy mejorados improved cuy marketers tried to increase consumption of the animal outside south america biological experimentation on domestic guinea pigs has been carried out since the century the animals were used so frequently as model organisms in the and centuries that the epithet guinea pig came into use to describe a human test subject since that time they have been largely replaced by other rodents such as mice and rats however they are still used in research primarily as models to study such human medical conditions as juvenile diabetes tuberculosis scurvy like humans they require dietary intake of vitamin c and pregnancy complications
Animals	Mouse	A mouse, plural mice, is a small rodent. Characteristically, mice are known to have a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail, and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (Mus musculus). Mice are also popular as pets. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter. Mice are classified under the order Rodentia. Typical mice are classified in the genus Mus. Mice are typically distinguished from rats by their size. Generally, when someone discovers a smaller muroid rodent, its common name includes the term mouse. If it is larger, the name includes the term rat. The common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically specific. Scientifically, the term mouse is not confined to members of Mus for example, but also applies to species from other genera such as the deer mouse, Peromyscus. Domestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse. This is attributable to breeding and different conditions in the wild. The best-known strain of mouse is the white lab mouse. It has more uniform traits that are appropriate to its use in research. Cats, wild dogs, foxes, birds of prey, snakes and even certain kinds of arthropods have been known to prey heavily upon mice. Despite this, mice populations remain plentiful. Due to its remarkable adaptability to almost any environment, the mouse is one of the most successful mammalian genera living on Earth today. In certain contexts, mice can be considered vermin. Vermin are a major source of crop damage,[1] as they are known to cause structural damage and spread disease. Mice spread disease through their feces and are often carriers of parasites.[2] In North America, breathing dust that has come in contact with mouse excrement has been linked to hantavirus, which may lead to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Primarily nocturnal[3] animals, mice compensate for their poor eyesight with a keen sense of hearing. They depend on their sense of smell to locate food and avoid predators.[4] In the wild, mice are known to build intricate burrows. These burrows have long entrances and are equipped with escape tunnels. In at least one species, the architectural design of a burrow is a genetic trait.[5]	a mouse plural mice is a small rodent characteristically mice are known to have a pointed snout small rounded ears a body length scaly tail and a high breeding rate the best known mouse species is the common house mouse mus musculus mice are also popular as pets in some places certain kinds of field mice are locally common they are known to invade homes for food and shelter mice are classified under the order rodentia typical mice are classified in the genus mus mice are typically distinguished from rats by their size generally when someone discovers a smaller muroid rodent its common name includes the term mouse if it is larger the name includes the term rat the common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically specific scientifically the term mouse is not confined to members of mus for example but also applies to species from other genera such as the deer mouse peromyscus domestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse this is attributable to breeding and different conditions in the wild the best known strain of mouse is the white lab mouse it has more uniform traits that are appropriate to its use in research cats wild dogs foxes birds of prey snakes and even certain kinds of arthropods have been known to prey heavily upon mice despite this mice populations remain plentiful due to its remarkable adaptability to almost any environment the mouse is one of the most successful mammalian genera living on earth today in certain contexts mice can be considered vermin vermin are a major source of crop damage as they are known to cause structural damage and spread disease mice spread disease through their feces and are often carriers of parasites in north america breathing dust that has come in contact with mouse excrement has been linked to hantavirus which may lead to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps primarily nocturnal animals mice compensate for their poor eyesight with a keen sense of hearing they depend on their sense of smell to locate food and avoid predators in the wild mice are known to build intricate burrows these burrows have long entrances and are equipped with escape tunnels in at least one species the architectural design of a burrow is a genetic trait
Animals	Penguin	Penguins (order Sphenisciformes /sfɪˈnɪsɪfɔːrmiːz/, family Spheniscidae /sfɪˈnɪsɪdiː/) are a group of aquatic flightless birds.  They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galápagos penguin, found north of the equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while swimming underwater. They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the temperate zone, but one species, the Galápagos penguin, lives near the equator. The largest living species is the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri):[1] on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb).  The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 33 cm (13 in) tall and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb).[2] Among extant penguins, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates. Some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human. These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than today.[which?]	penguins order sphenisciformes sfɪˈnɪsɪfɔːrmiːz family spheniscidae sfɪˈnɪsɪdiː are a group of aquatic flightless birds they live almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere with only one species the galápagos penguin found north of the equator highly adapted for life in the water penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming most penguins feed on krill fish squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while swimming underwater they spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea although almost all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere they are not found only in cold climates such as antarctica in fact only a few species of penguin live so far south several species are found in the temperate zone but one species the galápagos penguin lives near the equator the largest living species is the emperor penguin aptenodytes forsteri on average adults are about m ft in tall and weigh kg lb the smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin eudyptula minor also known as the fairy penguin which stands around cm in tall and weighs kg lb among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human these were not restricted to antarctic regions on the contrary subantarctic regions harboured high diversity and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region around km south of the equator mya in a climate decidedly warmer than today which
Animals	Cat	The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6] The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk, the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] It secretes and perceives pheromones.[8] Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species, and evoking population control.[10] Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC.[11] It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in ancient Egypt, as since around 3100 BC veneration was given to cats in ancient Egypt.[12][13] As of 2017[update], the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned.[14][15][16] In the United Kingdom, around 7.3 million cats lived in more than 4.8 million households as of 2019[update].[17]	the cat felis catus is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal it is the only domesticated species in the family felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family a cat can either be a house cat a farm cat or a feral cat the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents about cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries the cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species it has a strong flexible body quick reflexes sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey its night vision and sense of smell are well developed cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing purring trilling hissing growling and grunting as well as cat specific body language a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species it can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears such as those made by mice and other small mammals it secretes and perceives pheromones female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats a hobby known as cat fancy failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering as well as abandonment of pets resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide contributing to the extinction of entire bird mammal and reptile species and evoking population control cats were first domesticated in the near east around bc it was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in ancient egypt as since around bc veneration was given to cats in ancient egypt as of update the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the united states with million cats owned in the united kingdom around million cats lived in more than million households as of update
Animals	Dog	"The dog (Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf)[5] is a domesticated carnivore of the family Canidae. It is part of the wolf-like canids,[6] and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.[7][8][9][10][11] The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,[12][13][14] which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.[15] The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[14][16] and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[17] Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior,[18] and they can thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[19] Dogs vary widely in shape, size, and colors.[20] They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding disabled people, and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of ""man's best friend."""	the dog canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf is a domesticated carnivore of the family canidae it is part of the wolf like canids and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore the dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct the dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors sensory capabilities and physical attributes their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they can thrive on a starch rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids dogs vary widely in shape size and colors they perform many roles for humans such as hunting herding pulling loads protection assisting police and military companionship and more recently aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles this influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of man s best friend
Animals	Lion	The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane. With a typical head-to-body length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72 in). It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not. Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. In the Pleistocene, the lion ranged throughout Eurasia, Africa and North America, but today it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one critically endangered population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern. One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in the Upper Paleolithic period; carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France have been dated to 17,000 years ago, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures that coincided with the lion's former and current ranges.	the lion panthera leo is a species in the family felidae and a member of the genus panthera it has a muscular deep chested body short rounded head round ears and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail it is sexually dimorphic adult male lions have a prominent mane with a typical head to body length of cm in they are larger than females at cm in it is a social species forming groups called prides a lion pride consists of a few adult males related females and cubs groups of female lions usually hunt together preying mostly on large ungulates the lion is an apex and keystone predator although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans the species typically does not typically the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas but is absent in dense forests it is usually more diurnal than other big cats but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at twilight in the pleistocene the lion ranged throughout eurasia africa and north america but today it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub saharan africa and one critically endangered population in western india it has been listed as vulnerable on the iucn red list since because populations in african countries have declined by about since the early lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas although the cause of the decline is not fully understood habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings on national flags and in contemporary films and literature lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the roman empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late century cultural depictions of lions were prominent in the upper paleolithic period carvings and paintings from the lascaux and chauvet caves in france have been dated to years ago and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures that coincided with the lion s former and current ranges
Animals	Fox	"Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. Foxes have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush). Twelve species belong to the monophyletic ""true foxes"" group of genus Vulpes. Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.[1] Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. By far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.[2] The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World."	foxes are small to medium sized omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family canidae foxes have a flattened skull upright triangular ears a pointed slightly upturned snout and a long bushy tail or brush twelve species belong to the monophyletic true foxes group of genus vulpes approximately another current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the south american foxes or of the outlying group which consists of the bat eared fox gray fox and island fox foxes live on every continent except antarctica by far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox vulpes vulpes with about recognized subspecies the global distribution of foxes together with their widespread reputation for cunning has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world the hunting of foxes with packs of hounds long an established pursuit in europe especially in the british isles was exported by european settlers to various parts of the new world
Animals	Horse	"The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior. Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, possessing an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults.[4] Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years. Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited ""hot bloods"" with speed and endurance; ""cold bloods"", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and ""warmbloods"", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses. Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water, and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers."	the horse equus ferus caballus is one of two extant subspecies of equus ferus it is an odd toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family equidae the horse has evolved over the past to million years from a small multi toed creature eohippus into the large single toed animal of today humans began domesticating horses around bc and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by bc horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses these feral populations are not true wild horses as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated such as the endangered przewalski s horse a separate subspecies and the only remaining true wild horse there is an extensive specialized vocabulary used to describe equine related concepts covering everything from anatomy to life stages size colors markings breeds locomotion and behavior horses are adapted to run allowing them to quickly escape predators possessing an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight or flight response related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults female horses called mares carry their young for approximately months and a young horse called a foal can stand and run shortly following birth most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four they reach full adult development by age five and have an average lifespan of between and years horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament spirited hot bloods with speed and endurance cold bloods such as draft horses and some ponies suitable for slow heavy work and warmbloods developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes particularly in europe there are more than breeds of horse in the world today developed for many different uses horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non competitive recreational pursuits as well as in working activities such as police work agriculture entertainment and therapy horses were historically used in warfare from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed using many different styles of equipment and methods of control many products are derived from horses including meat milk hide hair bone and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares humans provide domesticated horses with food water and shelter as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers
Animals	Zebra	Zebras[a] (subgenus Hippotigris) are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three extant species: the Grévy's zebra (Equus grevyi), plains zebra (E. quagga) and the mountain zebra (E. zebra). Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses, the three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae. Zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these stripes, with most evidence supporting them as a form of protection from biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and southern Africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, shrublands and mountainous areas. Zebras are primarily grazers and can subsist on lower-quality vegetation. They are preyed on mainly by lions and typically flee when threatened but also bite and kick. Zebra species differ in social behaviour, with plains and mountain zebra living in stable harems consisting of an adult male or stallion, several adult females or mares, and their young or foals; while Grévy's zebra live alone or in loosely associated herds. In harem-holding species, adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while male Grévy's zebras establish territories which attract females and the species is promiscuous. Zebras communicate with various vocalisations, body postures and facial expressions. Social grooming strengthens social bonds in plains and mountain zebras. A zebra's dazzling stripes make them among the most recognisable mammals. They have been featured in art and stories in Africa and beyond. Historically, they have been highly sought after by exotic animal collectors, but unlike horses and donkeys, zebras have never been truly domesticated. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the Grévy's zebra as endangered, the mountain zebra as vulnerable and the plains zebra as near-threatened. The quagga, a type of plains zebra, was driven to extinction in the 19th century. Nevertheless, zebras can be found in numerous protected areas.	zebras a subgenus hippotigris are african equines with distinctive black and white striped coats there are three extant species the grévy s zebra equus grevyi plains zebra e quagga and the mountain zebra e zebra zebras share the genus equus with horses and asses the three groups being the only living members of the family equidae zebra stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual several theories have been proposed for the function of these stripes with most evidence supporting them as a form of protection from biting flies zebras inhabit eastern and southern africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs grasslands woodlands shrublands and mountainous areas zebras are primarily grazers and can subsist on lower quality vegetation they are preyed on mainly by lions and typically flee when threatened but also bite and kick zebra species differ in social behaviour with plains and mountain zebra living in stable harems consisting of an adult male or stallion several adult females or mares and their young or foals while grévy s zebra live alone or in loosely associated herds in harem holding species adult females mate only with their harem stallion while male grévy s zebras establish territories which attract females and the species is promiscuous zebras communicate with various vocalisations body postures and facial expressions social grooming strengthens social bonds in plains and mountain zebras a zebra s dazzling stripes make them among the most recognisable mammals they have been featured in art and stories in africa and beyond historically they have been highly sought after by exotic animal collectors but unlike horses and donkeys zebras have never been truly domesticated the international union for conservation of nature iucn lists the grévy s zebra as endangered the mountain zebra as vulnerable and the plains zebra as near threatened the quagga a type of plains zebra was driven to extinction in the century nevertheless zebras can be found in numerous protected areas
Animals	Donkey	"The donkey or ass (Equus africanus asinus)[1][2] is a domesticated member of the horse family, Equidae. The wild ancestor of the donkey is the African wild ass, E. africanus. The donkey has been used as a working animal for at least 5000 years. There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in underdeveloped countries, where they are used principally as draught or pack animals. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels. Small numbers of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries. A male donkey or ass is called a jack, a female a jenny or jennet;[3][4][5] a young donkey is a foal.[5] Jack donkeys are often used to mate with female horses to produce mules; the biological ""reciprocal"" of a mule, from a stallion and jenny as its parents instead, is called a hinny. Asses were first domesticated around 3000 BC, probably in Egypt or Mesopotamia,[6][7]  and have spread around the world. They continue to fill important roles in many places today.  While domesticated species are increasing in numbers,  the African wild ass is a critically endangered species. As beasts of burden and companions, asses and donkeys have worked together with humans for millennia."	the donkey or ass equus africanus asinus is a domesticated member of the horse family equidae the wild ancestor of the donkey is the african wild ass e africanus the donkey has been used as a working animal for at least years there are more than million donkeys in the world mostly in underdeveloped countries where they are used principally as draught or pack animals working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels small numbers of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries a male donkey or ass is called a jack a female a jenny or jennet a young donkey is a foal jack donkeys are often used to mate with female horses to produce mules the biological reciprocal of a mule from a stallion and jenny as its parents instead is called a hinny asses were first domesticated around bc probably in egypt or mesopotamia and have spread around the world they continue to fill important roles in many places today while domesticated species are increasing in numbers the african wild ass is a critically endangered species as beasts of burden and companions asses and donkeys have worked together with humans for millennia
Animals	Giraffe	"The giraffe (Giraffa) is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant.  It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. However, the existence of up to eight extant giraffe species has been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils. The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. Giraffes may be preyed on by lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through ""necking"", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young. The giraffe has intrigued various cultures, both ancient and modern, for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as vulnerable to extinction, and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves but estimates as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010."	the giraffe giraffa is an african artiodactyl mammal the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant it is traditionally considered to be one species giraffa camelopardalis with nine subspecies however the existence of up to eight extant giraffe species has been described based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear dna as well as morphological measurements of giraffa seven other species are extinct prehistoric species known from fossils the giraffe s chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs its horn like ossicones and its distinctive coat patterns it is classified under the family giraffidae along with its closest extant relative the okapi its scattered range extends from chad in the north to south africa in the south and from niger in the west to somalia in the east giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands their food source is leaves fruits and flowers of woody plants primarily acacia species which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach giraffes may be preyed on by lions leopards spotted hyenas and african wild dogs giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations males establish social hierarchies through necking which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon dominant males gain mating access to females which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young the giraffe has intrigued various cultures both ancient and modern for its peculiar appearance and has often been featured in paintings books and cartoons it is classified by the international union for conservation of nature as vulnerable to extinction and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves but estimates as of indicate that there are approximately members of giraffa in the wild more than were kept in zoos in
Animals	Panda	"The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo),[5] also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear[6] native to south central China.[1] It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name ""giant panda"" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.[7] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.[8][9] The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.[10] As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.[11][12] A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country.[13] As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different countries.[14] Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild,[13] while a 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000.[15] Some reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise.[16] In March 2015, conservation news site Mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864.[17] In 2016, the IUCN reclassified the species from ""endangered"" to ""vulnerable"",[12] affirming decade-long efforts to save the panda. While the dragon has often served as China's national symbol, internationally the giant panda has often filled this role. As such, it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts, for example, appearing since 1982 on gold panda bullion coins and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics."	the giant panda ailuropoda melanoleuca chinese 大熊猫 pinyin dàxióngmāo also known as the panda bear or simply the panda is a bear native to south central china it is characterised by large black patches around its eyes over the ears and across its round body the name giant panda is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda a neighboring musteloid though it belongs to the order carnivora the giant panda is a folivore with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than of its diet giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses wild tubers or even meat in the form of birds rodents or carrion in captivity they may receive honey eggs fish yams shrub leaves oranges or bananas along with specially prepared food the giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central china mainly in sichuan but also in neighbouring shaanxi and gansu as a result of farming deforestation and other development the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived and it is a conservation reliant vulnerable species a report showed pandas living in captivity inside china and another outside the country as of december giant pandas lived in captivity outside china living in zoos in different countries wild population estimates vary one estimate shows that there are about individuals living in the wild while a study via dna analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as to some reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise in march conservation news site mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had increased by or to in the iucn reclassified the species from endangered to vulnerable affirming decade long efforts to save the panda while the dragon has often served as china s national symbol internationally the giant panda has often filled this role as such it is becoming widely used within china in international contexts for example appearing since on gold panda bullion coins and as one of the five fuwa mascots of the beijing olympics
Sports	Football	Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.  Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football.[1][2] These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes. There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.[3][4][5] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.[6][7] The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[8]  By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[9]  In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[10]	football is a family of team sports that involve to varying degrees kicking a ball to score a goal unqualified the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used sports commonly called football include association football known as soccer in some countries gridiron football specifically american football or canadian football australian rules football rugby football either rugby union or rugby league and gaelic football these various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes there are a number of references to traditional ancient or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at english public schools during the century the expansion and cultural influence of the british empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of british influence outside the directly controlled empire by the end of the century distinct regional codes were already developing gaelic football for example deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage in the football league was founded in england becoming the first of many professional football competitions during the century several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world
Sports	Badminton	"Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are ""singles"" (with one player per side) and ""doubles"" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court. Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.[1] The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature. The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles,[2] with mixed doubles added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.[3]"	badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net although it may be played with larger teams the most common forms of the game are singles with one player per side and doubles with two players per side badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side s half of the court each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire service judge or in their absence the opposing side the shuttlecock is a feathered or in informal matches plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports in particular the feathers create much higher drag causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports the flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature the game developed in british india from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock european play came to be dominated by denmark but the game has become very popular in asia with recent competitions dominated by china since badminton has been a summer olympic sport with four events men s singles women s singles men s doubles and women s doubles with mixed doubles added four years later at high levels of play the sport demands excellent fitness players require aerobic stamina agility strength speed and precision it is also a technical sport requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements
Sports	Field Hockey	"Field hockey is a widely played team sport of the hockey family. The game can be played on grass, watered turf, artificial turf or synthetic field, as well as an indoor boarded surface. Each team plays with ten field players and a goalkeeper. Players use sticks made of wood, carbon fibre, fibre glass, or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities, to hit a round, hard, plastic hockey ball. The length of the hockey stick is based on the player's individual height: the top of the stick usually comes to the players hip, and taller players typically have longer sticks.[1] The sticks have a round side and a flat side, and only the flat face of the stick is allowed to be used. Use of the other side results in a foul. Goalies often have a different design of stick, although they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick. The specific goal-keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick, which is to give it more surface area to block the ball. The uniform consists of shin guards, shoes, shorts or a skirt, a mouthguard and a jersey. The game is played globally, particularly in parts of Western Europe, South Asia, Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and parts of the United States, primarily New England and the Mid-Atlantic states.[2][3] Known simply as ""hockey"" in most territories, the term ""field hockey"" is used primarily in Canada and the United States where ice hockey is more popular. In Sweden, the term landhockey is used, and to some degree in Norway, where the game is governed by the Norges Bandyforbund.[4] During play, goal keepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with any part of their body, while field players can only play the ball with the flat side of their stick. A player's hand is considered part of the stick if holding the stick. If the ball is touched with the rounded part of the stick, it will result in a penalty. Goal keepers also cannot play the ball with the back of their stick. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time, or there is a penalty shoot-out, depending on the format of the competition. There are many variations to overtime play that depend on the league or tournament rules. In American college play, a seven-aside overtime period consists of a 10-minute golden goal period with seven players for each team. If a tie still remains, the game enters a one-on-one competition where each team chooses five players to dribble from the 25-yard (23 m) line down to the circle against the opposing goalie. The player has eight seconds to score against the goalie while keeping the ball in bounds. The game ends after a goal is scored, the ball goes out of bounds, a foul is committed (ending in either a penalty stroke or flick or the end of the one-on-one) or time expires. If the tie still persists, more rounds are played until one team has scored. The governing body of field hockey is the International Hockey Federation (FIH), called the Fédération Internationale de Hockey in French, with men and women being represented internationally in competitions including the Olympic Games, World Cup, World League, Champions Trophy and Junior World Cup, with many countries running extensive junior, senior, and masters club competitions. The FIH is also responsible for organizing the Hockey Rules Board and developing the rules of the game. A popular variant of field hockey is indoor field hockey, which differs in a number of respects while embodying the primary principles of hockey. Indoor hockey is a 5-a-side variant, using a field which is reduced to approximately 40 m × 20 m (131 ft × 66 ft). Although many of the rules remain the same, including obstruction and feet, there are several key variations: players may not raise the ball unless shooting at goal, players may not hit the ball, instead using pushes to transfer it, and the sidelines are replaced with solid barriers, from which the ball will rebound and remain in play.[5] In addition, the regulation guidelines for the indoor field hockey stick require a slightly thinner, lighter stick than an outdoor one.[6]"	field hockey is a widely played team sport of the hockey family the game can be played on grass watered turf artificial turf or synthetic field as well as an indoor boarded surface each team plays with ten field players and a goalkeeper players use sticks made of wood carbon fibre fibre glass or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities to hit a round hard plastic hockey ball the length of the hockey stick is based on the player s individual height the top of the stick usually comes to the players hip and taller players typically have longer sticks the sticks have a round side and a flat side and only the flat face of the stick is allowed to be used use of the other side results in a foul goalies often have a different design of stick although they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick the specific goal keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick which is to give it more surface area to block the ball the uniform consists of shin guards shoes shorts or a skirt a mouthguard and a jersey the game is played globally particularly in parts of western europe south asia southern africa australia new zealand argentina and parts of the united states primarily new england and the mid atlantic states known simply as hockey in most territories the term field hockey is used primarily in canada and the united states where ice hockey is more popular in sweden the term landhockey is used and to some degree in norway where the game is governed by the norges bandyforbund during play goal keepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with any part of their body while field players can only play the ball with the flat side of their stick a player s hand is considered part of the stick if holding the stick if the ball is touched with the rounded part of the stick it will result in a penalty goal keepers also cannot play the ball with the back of their stick the team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins if the score is tied at the end of the game either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or there is a penalty shoot out depending on the format of the competition there are many variations to overtime play that depend on the league or tournament rules in american college play a seven aside overtime period consists of a minute golden goal period with seven players for each team if a tie still remains the game enters a one on one competition where each team chooses five players to dribble from the yard m line down to the circle against the opposing goalie the player has eight seconds to score against the goalie while keeping the ball in bounds the game ends after a goal is scored the ball goes out of bounds a foul is committed ending in either a penalty stroke or flick or the end of the one on one or time expires if the tie still persists more rounds are played until one team has scored the governing body of field hockey is the international hockey federation fih called the fédération internationale de hockey in french with men and women being represented internationally in competitions including the olympic games world cup world league champions trophy and junior world cup with many countries running extensive junior senior and masters club competitions the fih is also responsible for organizing the hockey rules board and developing the rules of the game a popular variant of field hockey is indoor field hockey which differs in a number of respects while embodying the primary principles of hockey indoor hockey is a a side variant using a field which is reduced to approximately m m ft ft although many of the rules remain the same including obstruction and feet there are several key variations players may not raise the ball unless shooting at goal players may not hit the ball instead using pushes to transfer it and the sidelines are replaced with solid barriers from which the ball will rebound and remain in play in addition the regulation guidelines for the indoor field hockey stick require a slightly thinner lighter stick than an outdoor one
Sports	Volleyball	Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.[1] It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. The complete set of rules is extensive,[2] but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court.[3] The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to 3 times, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively.[3] Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack, an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court. The rally continues, with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches, until either (1): a team makes a kill, grounding the ball on the opponent's court and winning the rally; or (2): a team commits a fault and loses the rally. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally. A few of the most common faults include:	volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team s court under organized rules it has been a part of the official program of the summer olympic games since tokyo the complete set of rules is extensive but play essentially proceeds as follows a player on one of the teams begins a rally by serving the ball tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm from behind the back boundary line of the court over the net and into the receiving team s court the receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court the team may touch the ball up to times but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively typically the first two touches are used to set up for an attack an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court the rally continues with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches until either a team makes a kill grounding the ball on the opponent s court and winning the rally or a team commits a fault and loses the rally the team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally a few of the most common faults include
Sports	Basketball	Basketball, colloquially referred to as hoops,[1] is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated. Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots—the lay-up, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling. The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one. Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.[2] The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.[3][4] Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas. The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world.

Sports	Tennis	Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will. Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis.[1] It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis. During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term tennis referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis. The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye. Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the Majors) are especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open also played on hard courts.	tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent singles or between two teams of two players each doubles each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent s court the object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return the player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point while the opposite player will tennis is an olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages the sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket including wheelchair users the modern game of tennis originated in birmingham england in the late century as lawn tennis it had close connections both to various field lawn games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis during most of the century in fact the term tennis referred to real tennis not lawn tennis the rules of modern tennis have changed little since the two exceptions are that from to the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times and the adoption of the tiebreak in the a recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point challenge system which allows a player to contest the line call of a point a system known as hawk eye tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport the four grand slam tournaments also referred to as the majors are especially popular the australian open played on hard courts the french open played on red clay courts wimbledon played on grass courts and the us open also played on hard courts
Sports	Cricket	"Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are ""out""). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information. Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string. The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in the Indian subcontinent, Australasia, the United Kingdom, southern Africa and the West Indies.[1] Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country."	cricket is a bat and ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a yard metre pitch with a wicket at each end each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps the batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat and running between the wickets while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this by preventing the ball from leaving the field and getting the ball to either wicket and dismiss each batter so they are out means of dismissal include being bowled when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket when ten batters have been dismissed the innings ends and the teams swap roles the game is adjudicated by two umpires aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches they communicate with two off field scorers who record the match s statistical information forms of cricket range from with each team batting for a single innings of overs to test matches played over five days traditionally cricketers play in all white kit but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours in addition to the basic kit some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball which is a hard solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string the earliest reference to cricket is in south east england in the mid century it spread globally with the expansion of the british empire with the first international matches in the second half of the century the game s governing body is the international cricket council icc which has over members twelve of which are full members who play test matches the game s rules the laws of cricket are maintained by marylebone cricket club mcc in london the sport is followed primarily in the indian subcontinent australasia the united kingdom southern africa and the west indies women s cricket which is organised and played separately has also achieved international standard the most successful side playing international cricket is australia which has won seven one day international trophies including five world cups more than any other country and has been the top rated test side more than any other country
Sports	Table Tennis	Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball, also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small rackets. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage. Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 1926. ITTF currently includes 226 member associations.[3] The table tennis official rules are specified in the ITTF handbook.[4] Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,[5] with several event categories. From 1988 until 2004, these were men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles and women's doubles. Since 2008, a team event has been played instead of the doubles.	table tennis also known as ping pong and whiff whaff is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball also known as the ping pong ball back and forth across a table using small rackets the game takes place on a hard table divided by a net except for the initial serve the rules are generally as follows players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once a point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules play is fast and demands quick reactions spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent s options giving the hitter a great advantage table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization international table tennis federation ittf founded in ittf currently includes member associations the table tennis official rules are specified in the ittf handbook table tennis has been an olympic sport since with several event categories from until these were men s singles women s singles men s doubles and women s doubles since a team event has been played instead of the doubles
Sports	Boxing	Boxing is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring. Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games—it also has its own World Championships. Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one-to-three-minute intervals called rounds. A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualification of an opponent, or resignation of an opponent.  When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing, the judges' scorecards determine the victor. In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, professional bouts are considered a draw. In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria. While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history, the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC.[2] The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece, where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC.[2] Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules.	boxing is a combat sport in which two people usually wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring amateur boxing is both an olympic and commonwealth games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games it also has its own world championships boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one to three minute intervals called rounds a winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing disqualification of an opponent or resignation of an opponent when the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing the judges scorecards determine the victor in the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges professional bouts are considered a draw in olympic boxing because a winner must be declared judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria while humans have fought in hand to hand combat since the dawn of human history the earliest evidence of fist fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient near east in the and millennia bc the earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to ancient greece where boxing was established as an olympic game in bc boxing evolved from and century prizefights largely in great britain to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid century with the introduction of the marquess of queensberry rules
Sports	Golf	"Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible. Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes, though recreational courses can be smaller, often having nine holes. Each hole on the course must contain a teeing ground to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 4 1⁄4 inches (11 cm) in diameter. There are other standard forms of terrain in between, such as the fairway, rough (long grass), bunkers (or ""sand traps""), and various hazards (water, rocks) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement. Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as stroke play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team, known as match play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels, but most especially at the elite level. The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland. The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764. Golf's first major, and the world's oldest tournament in existence, is The Open Championship, also known as the British Open, which was first played in 1860 at the Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland. This is one of the four major championships in men's professional golf, the other three being played in the United States: The Masters, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship."	golf is a club and ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible golf unlike most ball games cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game the game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of holes though recreational courses can be smaller often having nine holes each hole on the course must contain a teeing ground to start from and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup inches cm in diameter there are other standard forms of terrain in between such as the fairway rough long grass bunkers or sand traps and various hazards water rocks but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual known as stroke play or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team known as match play stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels but most especially at the elite level the modern game of golf originated in century scotland the hole round was created at the old course at st andrews in golf s first major and the world s oldest tournament in existence is the open championship also known as the british open which was first played in at the prestwick golf club in ayrshire scotland this is one of the four major championships in men s professional golf the other three being played in the united states the masters the u s open and the pga championship
Sports	Swimming	Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival.  Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs, the body, or both.  Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response.[1] Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities,[2][3][4][5] and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum.[6]  As a formalized sport, swimming features in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics.	swimming is the self propulsion of a person through water usually for recreation sport exercise or survival locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs the body or both humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth as a survival response swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities and in some countries swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum as a formalized sport swimming features in a range of local national and international competitions including every modern summer olympics
Sports	Handball	"Handball (also known as team handball, European handball or Olympic handball)[3] is a team sport in which two teams of seven players each (six outcourt players and a goalkeeper) pass a ball using their hands with the aim of throwing it into the goal of the other team. A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins. Modern handball is played on a court of 40 by 20 metres (131 by 66 ft), with a goal in the middle of each end. The goals are surrounded by a 6-meter (20 ft) zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed; goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while ""diving"" into it. The sport is usually played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball, Czech handball (which were more common in the past) and beach handball. The game is fast and high-scoring: professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each, though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago. Players may score hat tricks. Body contact is permitted for the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal. No protective equipment is mandated, but players may wear soft protective bands, pads and mouth guards.[4] The game was codified at the end of the 19th century in Denmark. The modern set of rules was published on 29 October 1917 in Berlin, which is seen as the date of birth of the sport,[1][5] and had several revisions since. The first official handball match was played in the same year in Germany.[1] The first international games were played under these rules for men in 1925 and for women in 1930. Men's handball was first played at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin as outdoors, and the next time at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich as indoors, and has been an Olympic sport since. Women's team handball was added at the 1976 Summer Olympics. The International Handball Federation was formed in 1946 and, as of 2016[update], has 197 member federations.[6] The sport is most popular in Europe, and European countries have won all medals but one in the men's world championships since 1938. In the women's world championships, only two non-European countries have won the title: South Korea and Brazil. The game also enjoys popularity in East Asia, North Africa and parts of South America."	handball also known as team handball european handball or olympic handball is a team sport in which two teams of seven players each six outcourt players and a goalkeeper pass a ball using their hands with the aim of throwing it into the goal of the other team a standard match consists of two periods of minutes and the team that scores more goals wins modern handball is played on a court of by metres by ft with a goal in the middle of each end the goals are surrounded by a meter ft zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while diving into it the sport is usually played indoors but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball czech handball which were more common in the past and beach handball the game is fast and high scoring professional teams now typically score between and goals each though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago players may score hat tricks body contact is permitted for the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal no protective equipment is mandated but players may wear soft protective bands pads and mouth guards the game was codified at the end of the century in denmark the modern set of rules was published on october in berlin which is seen as the date of birth of the sport and had several revisions since the first official handball match was played in the same year in germany the first international games were played under these rules for men in and for women in men s handball was first played at the summer olympics in berlin as outdoors and the next time at the summer olympics in munich as indoors and has been an olympic sport since women s team handball was added at the summer olympics the international handball federation was formed in and as of update has member federations the sport is most popular in europe and european countries have won all medals but one in the men s world championships since in the women s world championships only two non european countries have won the title south korea and brazil the game also enjoys popularity in east asia north africa and parts of south america

Sports	Cycling	"Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport.[1] People engaged in cycling are referred to as ""cyclists"",[2] ""bicyclists"",[3] or ""bikers"".[4] Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, ""cycling"" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs). Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide.[5] They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world. Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation[6][7] optimal for short to moderate distances. Bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, and much reduced traffic congestion. These lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required). By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.[8] In addition, cycling provides a variety of health benefits. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that cycling can reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease, and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles.[9] Cycling on stationary bikes have also been used as part of rehabilitation for lower limb injuries, particularly after hip surgery.[10] Individuals who cycle regularly have also reported mental health improvements, including less perceived stress and better vitality.[11] Among the disadvantages of cycling are the requirement of bicycles (excepting tricycles or quadricycles) to be balanced by the rider in order to remain upright, the reduced protection in crashes in comparison to motor vehicles,[12] often longer travel time (except in densely populated areas), vulnerability to weather conditions, difficulty in transporting passengers, and the fact that a basic level of fitness is required for cycling moderate to long distances."	cycling also called bicycling or biking is the use of bicycles for transport recreation exercise or sport people engaged in cycling are referred to as cyclists bicyclists or bikers apart from two wheeled bicycles cycling also includes the riding of unicycles tricycles quadricycles recumbent and similar human powered vehicles hpvs bicycles were introduced in the century and now number approximately one billion worldwide they are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with motor vehicles including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling easier parking increased maneuverability and access to roads bike paths and rural trails cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels less air or noise pollution and much reduced traffic congestion these lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large negligible damage to roads less road area required by fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve in addition cycling provides a variety of health benefits the world health organization who states that cycling can reduce the risk of cancers heart disease and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles cycling on stationary bikes have also been used as part of rehabilitation for lower limb injuries particularly after hip surgery individuals who cycle regularly have also reported mental health improvements including less perceived stress and better vitality among the disadvantages of cycling are the requirement of bicycles excepting tricycles or quadricycles to be balanced by the rider in order to remain upright the reduced protection in crashes in comparison to motor vehicles often longer travel time except in densely populated areas vulnerability to weather conditions difficulty in transporting passengers and the fact that a basic level of fitness is required for cycling moderate to long distances
Sports	Rugby Football	Rugby football is a collective name for the family of team sports of rugby union and rugby league, as well as the earlier forms of football from which both games, as well as Australian rules football and Gridiron football evolved. Canadian football and to a lesser extent American football were also broadly considered forms of rugby football but are seldom now referred to as such. The governing body of Canadian football, Football Canada, was known as the Canadian Rugby Union as late as 1967, more than fifty years after the sport parted ways with the established rules of rugby union or league.[1][2][3] Rugby football started about 1845 at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, England although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times. Rugby split into two sports in 1895, when twenty-one clubs split from the Rugby Football Union to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (later renamed the Rugby Football League in 1922) in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, over broken-time payments to players who took time off from work to play the sport, thus making rugby league the first code to turn professional and pay players. Rugby union turned professional one hundred years later in 1995, following the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa.[4][5] The respective world governing bodies are World Rugby (rugby union) and the Rugby League International Federation (rugby league). Rugby football was one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century.[6][7] Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports, with rugby league being much more similar to gridiron football. In addition to these two codes, both American and Canadian football evolved from rugby football in the beginning of the 20th century.	rugby football is a collective name for the family of team sports of rugby union and rugby league as well as the earlier forms of football from which both games as well as australian rules football and gridiron football evolved canadian football and to a lesser extent american football were also broadly considered forms of rugby football but are seldom now referred to as such the governing body of canadian football football canada was known as the canadian rugby union as late as more than fifty years after the sport parted ways with the established rules of rugby union or league rugby football started about at rugby school in rugby warwickshire england although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times rugby split into two sports in when twenty one clubs split from the rugby football union to form the northern rugby football union later renamed the rugby football league in in the george hotel huddersfield over broken time payments to players who took time off from work to play the sport thus making rugby league the first code to turn professional and pay players rugby union turned professional one hundred years later in following the rugby world cup in south africa the respective world governing bodies are world rugby rugby union and the rugby league international federation rugby league rugby football was one of many versions of football played at english public schools in the century although rugby league initially used rugby union rules they are now wholly separate sports with rugby league being much more similar to gridiron football in addition to these two codes both american and canadian football evolved from rugby football in the beginning of the century
Instruments	Guitar	"The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings.[1] It is typically played with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings with either a guitar pick or the fingers/fingernails of one hand, while simultaneously fretting (pressing the strings against the frets) with the fingers of the other hand. The sound of the vibrating strings is projected either acoustically, by means of the hollow chamber of the guitar (for an acoustic guitar), or through an electrical amplifier and a speaker. The guitar is a type of chordophone - wherein the sound is produced by way of a string, stretched between two fixed points, vibrating when plucked - traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar), the steel-string acoustic guitar and the archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a ""jazz guitar"". The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive finger-picking technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term ""finger-picking"" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States. The acoustic bass guitar is pitched one octave below a regular guitar. Electric guitars, introduced in the 1930s, use an amplifier and a loudspeaker that both makes the sound of the instrument loud enough for the performers and audience to hear, and, given that it produces an electric signal when played, that can electronically manipulate and shape the tone using an equalizer (e.g., bass and treble tone controls) and a wide variety of electronic effects units, the most commonly used ones being distortion (or ""overdrive"") and reverb. Early amplified guitars employed a hollow body, but solid wood guitars began to dominate during the 1960s and 1970s, as they are less prone to unwanted acoustic feedback ""howls"". As with acoustic guitars, there are a number of types of electric guitars, including hollowbody guitars, archtop guitars (used in jazz guitar, blues and rockabilly) and solid-body guitars, which are widely used in rock music. The loud, amplified sound and sonic power of the electric guitar played through a guitar amp has played a key role in the development of blues and rock music, both as an accompaniment instrument (playing riffs and chords) and performing guitar solos, and in many rock subgenres, notably heavy metal music and punk rock. The electric guitar has had a major influence on popular culture. The guitar is used in a wide variety of musical genres worldwide.

Instruments	Piano	"The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 (the exact year is uncertain), in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a softer material (modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos used leather). It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings. The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte, the Italian term for the early 1700s versions of the instrument,  which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte (key cymbal with quieter and louder)[1] and fortepiano. The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate ""soft"" and ""loud"" respectively,[2] in this context referring to the variations in volume (i.e., loudness) produced in response to a pianist's touch or pressure on the keys: the greater the velocity of a key press, the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings, and the louder the sound of the note produced and the stronger the attack. The name was created as a contrast to harpsichord, a musical instrument that does not allow variation in volume; compared to the harpsichord, the first fortepianos in the 1700s had a quieter sound and smaller dynamic range.[3] A piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings, which are strung under great tension on a heavy metal frame. Pressing one or more keys on the piano's keyboard causes a wooden or plastic hammer (typically padded with firm felt) to strike the strings. The hammer rebounds from the strings, and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency.[4] These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air. When the key is released, a damper stops the strings' vibration, ending the sound. Notes can be sustained, even when the keys are released by the fingers and thumbs, by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument. The sustain pedal enables pianists to play musical passages that would otherwise be impossible, such as sounding a 10-note chord in the lower register and then, while this chord is being continued with the sustain pedal, shifting both hands to the treble range to play a melody and arpeggios over the top of this sustained chord. Unlike the pipe organ and harpsichord, two major keyboard instruments widely used before the piano, the piano allows gradations of volume and tone according to how forcefully or softly a performer presses or strikes the keys. Most modern pianos have a row of 88 black and white keys, 52 white keys for the notes of the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A and B) and 36 shorter black keys, which are raised above the white keys, and set further back on the keyboard. This means that the piano can play 88 different pitches (or ""notes""), going from the deepest bass range to the highest treble. The black keys are for the ""accidentals"" (F♯/G♭, G♯/A♭, A♯/B♭, C♯/D♭, and D♯/E♭), which are needed to play in all twelve keys. More rarely, some pianos have additional keys (which require additional strings). Most notes have three strings, except for the bass, which graduates from one to two. The strings are sounded when keys are pressed or struck, and silenced by dampers when the hands are lifted from the keyboard. Although an acoustic piano has strings, it is usually classified as a percussion instrument rather than as a stringed instrument, because the strings are struck rather than plucked (as with a harpsichord or spinet); in the Hornbostel–Sachs system of instrument classification, pianos are considered chordophones. There are two main types of piano: the grand piano and the upright piano. The grand piano has a better sound and gives the player a more precise control of the keys, and is therefore the preferred choice for every situation in which the available floor-space and the budget will allow, as well as often being considered a requirement in venues where skilled pianists will frequently give public performances. The upright piano, which necessarily involves some compromise in both tone and key action compared to a grand piano of equivalent quality, is nevertheless much more widely used, because it occupies less space (allowing it to fit comfortably in a room where a grand piano would be too large) and is significantly less expensive. During the 1800s, influenced by the musical trends of the Romantic music era, innovations such as the cast iron frame (which allowed much greater string tensions) and aliquot stringing gave grand pianos a more powerful sound, with a longer sustain and richer tone. In the nineteenth century, a family's piano played the same role that a radio or phonograph played in the twentieth century; when a nineteenth-century family wanted to hear a newly published musical piece or symphony, they could hear it by having a family member play a simplified version on the piano. During the nineteenth century, music publishers produced many types of musical works (symphonies, opera overtures, waltzes, etc.) in arrangements for piano, so that music lovers could play and hear the popular pieces of the day in their home. The piano is widely employed in classical, jazz, traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances, accompaniment, and for composing, songwriting and rehearsals. Although the piano is very heavy and thus not portable and is expensive (in comparison with other widely used accompaniment instruments, such as the acoustic guitar), its musical versatility (i.e., its wide pitch range, ability to play chords, louder or softer notes and two or more independent musical lines at the same time), the large number of musicians - both amateurs and professionals - trained in playing it, and its wide availability in performance venues, schools and rehearsal spaces have made it one of the Western world's most familiar musical instruments."	the piano is an

Instruments	Violin	"The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string instrument) in the violin family. Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the family in regular use.[a] The violin typically has four strings, usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. It can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow (col legno). Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments. Violins are also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music and in jazz. Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion, with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound. The violin has come to be incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it. The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection. In Europe, it served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music, such as the viola.[1][2][3] Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari, Guarneri, Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) and by Jacob Stainer in Austria. According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or equal it, though this belief is disputed.[4][5] Great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced commercial ""trade violins"" coming from cottage industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt. Many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers. The components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood. Violins can be strung with gut, Perlon or other synthetic, or steel strings. A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker. One who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or bowmaker."	the violin sometimes known as a fiddle is a wooden chordophone string instrument in the violin family most violins have a hollow wooden body it is the smallest and thus highest pitched instrument soprano in the family in regular use a the violin typically has four strings usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings it can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers pizzicato and in specialized cases by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow col legno violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres they are most prominent in the western classical tradition both in ensembles from chamber music to orchestras and as solo instruments violins are also important in many varieties of folk music including country music bluegrass music and in jazz electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound the violin has come to be incorporated in many non western music cultures including indian music and iranian music the name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it the violin was first known in century italy with some further modifications occurring in the and centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection in europe it served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in western classical music such as the viola violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the stradivari guarneri guadagnini and amati families from the to the century in brescia and cremona italy and by jacob stainer in austria according to their reputation the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or equal it though this belief is disputed great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of less famous makers as well as still greater numbers of mass produced commercial trade violins coming from cottage industries in places such as saxony bohemia and mirecourt many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by sears roebuck and co and other mass merchandisers the components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood violins can be strung with gut perlon or other synthetic or steel strings a person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker one who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or bowmaker
Instruments	Drums	"A drum kit – also called a drum set, trap set (an abbreviation of the word, ""contraption"")[1] or simply drums – is a collection of drums, cymbals and other percussion instruments, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player,[2] with drumsticks held in both hands and the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. A drum kit consists of a mix of drums (categorized classically as membranophones, Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 2) and idiophones ⁠– ⁠most significantly cymbals, but can also include the woodblock and cowbell (classified as Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 1).[3] In the 2000s, some kits also include electronic instruments (Hornbostel-Sachs classification 53). Also, both hybrid (mixing acoustic instruments and electronic drums) and entirely electronic kits are used. A standard modern kit (for a right-handed player), as used in popular music and taught in music schools,[4][5][6] contains:"	a drum kit also called a drum set trap set an abbreviation of the word contraption or simply drums is a collection of drums cymbals and other percussion instruments which are set up on stands to be played by a single player with drumsticks held in both hands and the feet operating pedals that control the hi hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum a drum kit consists of a mix of drums categorized classically as membranophones hornbostel sachs high level classification and idiophones most significantly cymbals but can also include the woodblock and cowbell classified as hornbostel sachs high level classification in the some kits also include electronic instruments hornbostel sachs classification also both hybrid mixing acoustic instruments and electronic drums and entirely electronic kits are used a standard modern kit for a right handed player as used in popular music and taught in music schools contains
Instruments	Saxophone	"The saxophone (referred to colloquially as the sax) is a family of woodwind instruments usually made of brass and played with a single-reed mouthpiece.[2] Although most saxophones are made from brass, they are categorized as woodwind instruments, because sound is produced by an oscillating reed (traditionally made out of woody cane) rather than lips vibrating in a mouthpiece cup as with the brass instrument family. As with the other woodwind instruments, the pitch of the note being played is controlled by covering holes in the body tube to control the resonant frequency of the air column by changing the effective length of the tube.[3] The player covers or uncovers the holes by pressing keys. The saxophone is used in classical music (such as concert bands, chamber music, solo repertoire, and, occasionally, orchestras), military bands, marching bands, jazz (such as big bands and jazz combos), and contemporary music. The saxophone is also used as a solo and melody instrument or as a member of a horn section in some styles of rock and roll and popular music. Saxophone players are called saxophonists.[2] Since the first saxophone was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in the early 1840s,[4] saxophones have been produced in a variety of series distinguished by transpositions within instrument sets and tuning standard. Sax patented the saxophone on 28 June 1846, in two groups of seven instruments each. Each series consisted of instruments ranked by pitch, in alternating transposition. The series pitched in B♭ and E♭ soon became dominant and most saxophones encountered today are from this series. Instruments from the series pitched in C and F never gained a foothold and constituted only a small percentage of instruments made by Sax. High Pitch (also marked ""H"" or ""HP"") saxophones tuned sharper than the (concert) A = 440 Hz standard were produced into the early twentieth century for sonic qualities suited for outdoor uses, but are not playable to modern tuning and are considered obsolete. Low Pitch (also marked ""L"" or ""LP"") saxophones are equivalent in tuning to modern instruments. C soprano and C melody saxophones were produced for the casual market as parlor instruments during the early twentieth century. Saxophones in F were introduced during the late 1920s but never gained acceptance. The modern saxophone family consists entirely of instruments in the B♭ – E♭ series, historical and experimental instruments notwithstanding.

Instruments	Cello	The cello (/ˈtʃɛloʊ/ CHEL-oh; plural celli or cellos) or violoncello (/ˌvaɪələnˈtʃɛloʊ/ VY-ə-lən-CHEL-oh;[1] Italian pronunciation: [vjolonˈtʃɛllo]) is a bowed (and occasionally plucked) string instrument of the violin family. Its four strings are usually tuned in perfect fifths: from low to high, C2, G2, D3 and A3. The viola's four strings are each an octave higher. Music for the cello is generally written in the bass clef, with tenor clef and treble clef used for higher-range passages. Played by a cellist or violoncellist, it enjoys a large solo repertoire with and without accompaniment, as well as numerous concerti. As a solo instrument, the cello uses its whole range, from bass to soprano, and in chamber music such as string quartets and the orchestra's string section, it often plays the bass part, where it may be reinforced an octave lower by the double basses. Figured bass music of the Baroque-era typically assumes a cello, viola da gamba or bassoon as part of the basso continuo group alongside chordal instruments such as organ, harpsichord, lute or theorbo. Cellos are found in many other ensembles, from modern Chinese orchestras to cello rock bands.	the cello ˈtʃɛloʊ chel oh plural celli or cellos or violoncello ˌvaɪələnˈtʃɛloʊ vy ə lən chel oh italian pronunciation vjolonˈtʃɛllo is a bowed and occasionally plucked string instrument of the violin family its four strings are usually tuned in perfect fifths from low to high and the viola s four strings are each an octave higher music for the cello is generally written in the bass clef with tenor clef and treble clef used for higher range passages played by a cellist or violoncellist it enjoys a large solo repertoire with and without accompaniment as well as numerous concerti as a solo instrument the cello uses its whole range from bass to soprano and in chamber music such as string quartets and the orchestra s string section it often plays the bass part where it may be reinforced an octave lower by the double basses figured bass music of the baroque era typically assumes a cello viola da gamba or bassoon as part of the basso continuo group alongside chordal instruments such as organ harpsichord lute or theorbo cellos are found in many other ensembles from modern chinese orchestras to cello rock bands
Instruments	Flute	"The flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group. Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of Hornbostel–Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones.[1] A musician who plays the flute can be referred to as a flute player, flautist, flutist or, less commonly, fluter or flutenist. Flutes are the earliest known identifiable musical instruments, as paleolithic examples with hand-bored holes have been found. A number of flutes dating to about 43,000 to 35,000 years ago have been found in the Swabian Jura region of present-day Germany. These flutes demonstrate that a developed musical tradition existed from the earliest period of modern human presence in Europe.[2][3] While the oldest flutes currently known were found in Europe, Asia too has a long history with the instrument that has continued into the present day. In China, a playable bone flute was discovered, about 9000 years old.[4] The Americas also had an ancient flute culture, with instruments found in Caral, Peru, dating back 5000 years [5] and Labrador dating back approximately 7500 years.[6] Historians have found the bamboo flute has a long history as well, especially China and India. Flutes made history in records and artworks starting in the Zhou dynasty. The oldest written sources reveal the Chinese were using the kuan (a reed instrument) and hsio (or xiao, an end-blown flute, often of bamboo) in the 12th-11th centuries b.c., followed by the chi (or ch'ih) in the 9th century b.c. and the yüeh in the 8th century b.c.[7]  Of these, the chi is the oldest documented cross flute or transverse flute, and was made from bamboo.[7][8] The cross flute (Sanscrit: vāṃśī) was ""the outstanding wind instrument of ancient India,"" according to Curt Sachs.[9] He said that religious artwork depicting ""celestial music"" instruments was linked to music with an ""aristocratic character.""[9] The Indian bamboo cross flute, Bansuri, was sacred to Krishna, and he is depicted in Hindu art with the instrument.[9] In India, the cross flute appeared in reliefs from the 1st century a.d. at Sanchi and Amaravati from the 2nd-4th centuries a.d.[9][10] In Europe, although there had been flutes in Europe in prehistoric times, in more recent millenia the flute was absent from Europe until its arrival from Asia, by way of ""North Africa, Hungary, and Bohemia.""[11] The end-blown flute began to be seen in illustration in the 11th century.[11] Transverse flutes entered Europe through Byzantium and were depicted in Greek art about 800 A.D.[12] The transverse spread into Europe by way of Germany, and was known in Europe as the German flute.[12]"	the flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group unlike woodwind instruments with reeds a flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening according to the instrument classification of hornbostel sachs flutes are categorized as edge blown aerophones a musician who plays the flute can be referred to as a flute player flautist flutist or less commonly fluter or flutenist flutes are the earliest known identifiable musical instruments as paleolithic examples with hand bored holes have been found a number of flutes dating to about to years ago have been found in the swabian jura region of present day germany these flutes demonstrate that a developed musical tradition existed from the earliest period of modern human presence in europe while the oldest flutes currently known were found in europe asia too has a long history with the instrument that has continued into the present day in china a playable bone flute was discovered about years old the americas also had an ancient flute culture with instruments found in caral peru dating back years and labrador dating back approximately years historians have found the bamboo flute has a long history as well especially china and india flutes made history in records and artworks starting in the zhou dynasty the oldest written sources reveal the chinese were using the kuan a reed instrument and hsio or xiao an end blown flute often of bamboo in the centuries b c followed by the chi or ch ih in the century b c and the yüeh in the century b c of these the chi is the oldest documented cross flute or transverse flute and was made from bamboo the cross flute sanscrit vāṃśī was the outstanding wind instrument of ancient india according to curt sachs he said that religious artwork depicting celestial music instruments was linked to music with an aristocratic character the indian bamboo cross flute bansuri was sacred to krishna and he is depicted in hindu art with the instrument in india the cross flute appeared in reliefs from the century a d at sanchi and amaravati from the centuries a d in europe although there had been flutes in europe in prehistoric times in more recent millenia the flute was absent from europe until its arrival from asia by way of north africa hungary and bohemia the end blown flute began to be seen in illustration in the century transverse flutes entered europe through byzantium and were depicted in greek art about a d the transverse spread into europe by way of germany and was known in europe as the german flute
Instruments	Clarinet	"The clarinet is a family of woodwind instruments. It has a single-reed mouthpiece, a straight, cylindrical tube with an almost cylindrical bore, and a flared bell. A person who plays a clarinet is called a clarinetist (sometimes spelled clarinettist). While the similarity in sound between the earliest clarinets and the trumpet may hold a clue to its name,  other factors may have been involved. During the Late Baroque era, composers such as Bach and Handel were making new demands on the skills of their trumpeters, who were often required to play difficult melodic passages in the high, or as it came to be called, clarion register. Since the trumpets of this time had no valves or pistons, melodic passages would often require the use of the highest part of the trumpet's range, where the harmonics were close enough together to produce scales of adjacent notes as opposed to the gapped scales or arpeggios of the lower register. The trumpet parts that required this specialty were known by the term clarino and this in turn came to apply to the musicians themselves. It is probable that the term clarinet may stem from the diminutive version of the 'clarion' or 'clarino' and it has been suggested that clarino players may have helped themselves out by playing particularly difficult passages on these newly developed ""mock trumpets"".[1] Johann Christoph Denner is generally believed to have invented the clarinet in Germany around the year 1700 by adding a register key to the earlier chalumeau, usually in the key of C. Over time, additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve the tone and playability.[2] In modern times, the most common clarinet is the B♭ clarinet. However, the clarinet in A, pitched a semitone lower, is regularly used in orchestral, chamber and solo music. An orchestral clarinetist must own both a clarinet in A and B♭ since the repertoire is divided fairly evenly between the two. Since the middle of the 19th century, the bass clarinet (nowadays invariably in B♭ but with extra keys to extend the register down to low written C3) has become an essential addition to the orchestra. The clarinet family ranges from the (extremely rare) BBB♭ octo-contrabass to the A♭ piccolo clarinet.

Instruments	Trumpet	"The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet with the highest register in the brass family, to the bass trumpet, which is pitched one octave below the standard B♭ or C Trumpet. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signalling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BCE. They began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century.[1] Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through nearly-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a ""buzzing"" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument.[2] Since the late 15th century, trumpets have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape.[3] There are many distinct types of trumpet, with the most common being pitched in B♭ (a transposing instrument), having a tubing length of about 1.48 m (4 ft 10 in). Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing, whereas modern instruments generally have three (or sometimes four) valves in order to change their pitch. There are eight combinations of three valves, making seven different tubing lengths, with the third valve sometimes used as an alternate fingering equivalent to the 1–2 combination. Most trumpets have valves of the piston type, while some have the rotary type. The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings (especially in German and German-style orchestras), although this practice varies by country. Each valve, when engaged, increases the length of tubing, lowering the pitch of the instrument. A musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter.[4]"	the trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles the trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet with the highest register in the brass family to the bass trumpet which is pitched one octave below the standard b or c trumpet trumpet like instruments have historically been used as signalling devices in battle or hunting with examples dating back to at least bce they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late or early century trumpets are used in art music styles for instance in orchestras concert bands and jazz ensembles as well as in popular music they are played by blowing air through nearly closed lips called the player s embouchure producing a buzzing sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument since the late century trumpets have primarily been constructed of brass tubing usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape there are many distinct types of trumpet with the most common being pitched in b a transposing instrument having a tubing length of about m ft in early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing whereas modern instruments generally have three or sometimes four valves in order to change their pitch there are eight combinations of three valves making seven different tubing lengths with the third valve sometimes used as an alternate fingering equivalent to the combination most trumpets have valves of the piston type while some have the rotary type the use of rotary valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings especially in german and german style orchestras although this practice varies by country each valve when engaged increases the length of tubing lowering the pitch of the instrument a musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter
Instruments	Pipe Organ	"The pipe organ is a musical instrument that produces sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through the organ pipes selected from a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes are provided in sets called ranks, each of which has a common timbre and volume throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have many ranks of pipes of differing timbre, pitch, and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops. A pipe organ has one or more keyboards (called manuals) played by the hands, and a pedal clavier played by the feet; each keyboard controls its own division, or group of stops. The keyboard(s), pedalboard, and stops are housed in the organ's console. The organ's continuous supply of wind allows it to sustain notes for as long as the corresponding keys are pressed, unlike the piano and harpsichord whose sound begins to dissipate immediately after a key is depressed. The smallest portable pipe organs may have only one or two dozen pipes and one manual; the largest may have over 33,000 pipes and seven manuals.[2] A list of some of the most notable and largest pipe organs in the world can be viewed at List of pipe organs. A list consisting the ranking of the largest organs in the world—based on the criterion constructed by Michał Szostak, i.e. 'the number of ranks and additional equipment managed from a single console—can be found in 'The Organ'[3] and in 'The Vox Humana'.[4] The origins of the pipe organ can be traced back to the hydraulis in Ancient Greece, in the 3rd century BC,[5] in which the wind supply was created by the weight of displaced water in an airtight container. By the 6th or 7th century AD, bellows were used to supply Byzantine organs with wind.[5][6] Beginning in the 12th century, the organ began to evolve into a complex instrument capable of producing different timbres. A pipe organ with ""great leaden pipes"" was sent to the West by the Byzantine emperor Constantine V as a gift to Pepin the Short, King of the Franks, in 757.[7]  Pepin's son Charlemagne requested a similar organ for his chapel in Aachen in 812, beginning the pipe organ's establishment in Western European church music.[8]   In England, ""The first organ of which any detailed record exists was built in Winchester Cathedral in the 10th century. It was a huge machine with 400 pipes, which needed two men to play it and 70 men to blow it, and its sound could be heard throughout the city.""[9]  By the 17th century, most of the sounds available on the modern classical organ had been developed.[10] From that time, the pipe organ was the most complex man-made device[11]—a distinction it retained until it was displaced by the telephone exchange in the late 19th century.[12] Pipe organs are installed in churches, synagogues, concert halls, schools, other public buildings and in private properties. They are used in the performance of classical music, sacred music, secular music, and popular music. In the early 20th century, pipe organs were installed in theaters to accompany the screening of films during the silent movie era; in municipal auditoria, where orchestral transcriptions were popular; and in the homes of the wealthy.[13] The beginning of the 21st century has seen a resurgence in installations in concert halls. The organ boasts a substantial repertoire, which spans over 500 years.[14]"	the pipe organ is a musical instrument that produces sound by driving pressurized air called wind through the organ pipes selected from a keyboard because each pipe produces a single pitch the pipes are provided in sets called ranks each of which has a common timbre and volume throughout the keyboard compass most organs have many ranks of pipes of differing timbre pitch and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops a pipe organ has one or more keyboards called manuals played by the hands and a pedal clavier played by the feet each keyboard controls its own division or group of stops the keyboard s pedalboard and stops are housed in the organ s console the organ s continuous supply of wind allows it to sustain notes for as long as the corresponding keys are pressed unlike the piano and harpsichord whose sound begins to dissipate immediately after a key is depressed the smallest portable pipe organs may have only one or two dozen pipes and one manual the largest may have over pipes and seven manuals a list of some of the most notable and largest pipe organs in the world can be viewed at list of pipe organs a list consisting the ranking of the largest organs in the world based on the criterion constructed by michał szostak i e the number of ranks and additional equipment managed from a single console can be found in the organ and in the vox humana the origins of the pipe organ can be traced back to the hydraulis in ancient greece in the century bc in which the wind supply was created by the weight of displaced water in an airtight container by the or century ad bellows were used to supply byzantine organs with wind beginning in the century the organ began to evolve into a complex instrument capable of producing different timbres a pipe organ with great leaden pipes was sent to the west by the byzantine emperor constantine v as a gift to pepin the short king of the franks in pepin s son charlemagne requested a similar organ for his chapel in aachen in beginning the pipe organ s establishment in western european church music in england the first organ of which any detailed record exists was built in winchester cathedral in the century it was a huge machine with pipes which needed two men to play it and men to blow it and its sound could be heard throughout the city by the century most of the sounds available on the modern classical organ had been developed from that time the pipe organ was the most complex man made device a distinction it retained until it was displaced by the telephone exchange in the late century pipe organs are installed in churches synagogues concert halls schools other public buildings and in private properties they are used in the performance of classical music sacred music secular music and popular music in the early century pipe organs were installed in theaters to accompany the screening of films during the silent movie era in municipal auditoria where orchestral transcriptions were popular and in the homes of the wealthy the beginning of the century has seen a resurgence in installations in concert halls the organ boasts a substantial repertoire which spans over years

It generally employs four nylon strings.[1][2][3] The ukulele is a small guitar-like instrument, which was introduced to Hawaii by Portuguese immigrants from Madeira. It gained great popularity elsewhere in the United States during the early 20th century and from there spread internationally. The tone and volume of the instrument vary with size and construction. Ukuleles commonly come in four sizes: soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone.	the ukulele ˌjuːkəˈleɪli yoo kə lay lee from hawaiian ʻukulele ˈʔukuˈlɛlɛ approximately oo koo leh leh is a member of the lute family of instruments it generally employs four nylon strings the ukulele is a small guitar like instrument which was introduced to hawaii by portuguese immigrants from madeira it gained great popularity elsewhere in the united states during the early century and from there spread internationally the tone and volume of the instrument vary with size and construction ukuleles commonly come in four sizes soprano concert tenor and baritone
Instruments	Trombone	"The trombone is a musical instrument in the brass family. As with all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips (embouchure) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Unlike most other brass instruments, which have valves that, when pressed, alter the pitch of the instrument, trombones instead have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch. However, many modern trombone models also have a valve attachment which lowers the pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves similar to those on the trumpet. The word ""trombone"" derives from Italian Tromba (trumpet) and -one (a suffix meaning ""large""), so the name means ""large trumpet"". The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart, the baritone, in contrast to its conical valved counterparts: the cornet, the euphonium, and the French horn. The most frequently encountered trombones are the tenor trombone and bass trombone. The most common variant, the tenor, is a non-transposing instrument pitched in B♭, an octave below the B♭ trumpet and an octave above the pedal B♭ tuba. The once common E♭ alto trombone became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, but it is now resurging due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works. Trombone music is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef, although exceptions do occur, notably in British brass-band music where the tenor trombone is presented as a B♭ transposing instrument, written in treble clef. A person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player."	the trombone is a musical instrument in the brass family as with all brass instruments sound is produced when the player s vibrating lips embouchure cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate unlike most other brass instruments which have valves that when pressed alter the pitch of the instrument trombones instead have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch however many modern trombone models also have a valve attachment which lowers the pitch of the instrument variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves similar to those on the trumpet the word trombone derives from italian tromba trumpet and one a suffix meaning large so the name means large trumpet the trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart the baritone in contrast to its conical valved counterparts the cornet the euphonium and the french horn the most frequently encountered trombones are the tenor trombone and bass trombone the most common variant the tenor is a non transposing instrument pitched in b an octave below the b trumpet and an octave above the pedal b tuba the once common e alto trombone became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor but it is now resurging due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works trombone music is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef although exceptions do occur notably in british brass band music where the tenor trombone is presented as a b transposing instrument written in treble clef a person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player
Instruments	Viola	"The viola (/viˈoʊlə/ vee-OH-lə,[1][2] also UK: /vaɪˈoʊlə/ vy-OH-lə,[3][4][a] Italian: [ˈvjɔːla, viˈɔːla]) is a string instrument that is bowed, plucked, or played with varying techniques. It is slightly larger than a violin and has a lower and deeper sound. Since the 18th century, it has been the middle or alto voice of the violin family, between the violin (which is tuned a perfect fifth above) and the cello (which is tuned an octave below).[5] The strings from low to high are typically tuned to C3, G3, D4, and A4. In the past, the viola varied in size and style, as did its names.[citation needed] The word viola originates from the Italian language. The Italians often used the term: viola da braccio meaning literally: 'of the arm'. ""Brazzo"" was another Italian word for the viola, which the Germans adopted as Bratsche. The French had their own names: cinquiesme was a small viola, haute contre was a large viola, and taile was a tenor. Today, the French use the term alto, a reference to its range. The viola was popular in the heyday of five-part harmony, up until the eighteenth century, taking three lines of the harmony and occasionally playing the melody line.[citation needed] Music for the viola differs from most other instruments in that it primarily uses the alto clef. When viola music has substantial sections in a higher register, it switches to the treble clef to make it easier to read. The viola often plays the ""inner voices"" in string quartets and symphonic writing, and it is more likely than the first violin to play accompaniment parts. The viola occasionally plays a major, soloistic role in orchestral music. Examples include the symphonic poem, ""Don Quixote"", by Richard Strauss, and the symphony/concerto, ""Harold en Italie"", by Hector Berlioz.[citation needed] In the earlier part of the 20th century, more composers began to write for the viola, encouraged by the emergence of specialized soloists such as Lionel Tertis and William Primrose. English composers Arthur Bliss, York Bowen, Benjamin Dale, Frank Bridge, Benjamin Britten, Rebecca Clarke and Ralph Vaughan Williams all wrote substantial chamber and concert works.[citation needed] Many of these pieces were commissioned by, or written for Lionel Tertis.[citation needed] William Walton, Bohuslav Martinů, Toru Takemitsu, Tibor Serly, Alfred Schnittke, and Béla Bartók have written well-known viola concertos. The concerti by Béla Bartók, Paul Hindemith, Carl Stamitz, Georg Philipp Telemann, and William Walton are considered major works of the viola repertoire.[citation needed] Paul Hindemith, who was a violist, wrote a substantial amount of music for viola, including the concerto, ""Der Schwanendreher""."	the viola viˈoʊlə vee oh lə also uk vaɪˈoʊlə vy oh lə a italian ˈvjɔːla viˈɔːla is a string instrument that is bowed plucked or played with varying techniques it is slightly larger than a violin and has a lower and deeper sound since the century it has been the middle or alto voice of the violin family between the violin which is tuned a perfect fifth above and the cello which is tuned an octave below the strings from low to high are typically tuned to and in the past the viola varied in size and style as did its names citation needed the word viola originates from the italian language the italians often used the term viola da braccio meaning literally of the arm brazzo was another italian word for the viola which the germans adopted as bratsche the french had their own names cinquiesme was a small viola haute contre was a large viola and taile was a tenor today the french use the term alto a reference to its range the viola was popular in the heyday of five part harmony up until the eighteenth century taking three lines of the harmony and occasionally playing the melody line citation needed music for the viola differs from most other instruments in that it primarily uses the alto clef when viola music has substantial sections in a higher register it switches to the treble clef to make it easier to read the viola often plays the inner voices in string quartets and symphonic writing and it is more likely than the first violin to play accompaniment parts the viola occasionally plays a major soloistic role in orchestral music examples include the symphonic poem don quixote by richard strauss and the symphony concerto harold en italie by hector berlioz citation needed in the earlier part of the century more composers began to write for the viola encouraged by the emergence of specialized soloists such as lionel tertis and william primrose english composers arthur bliss york bowen benjamin dale frank bridge benjamin britten rebecca clarke and ralph vaughan williams all wrote substantial chamber and concert works citation needed many of these pieces were commissioned by or written for lionel tertis citation needed william walton bohuslav martinů toru takemitsu tibor serly alfred schnittke and béla bartók have written well known viola concertos the concerti by béla bartók paul hindemith carl stamitz georg philipp telemann and william walton are considered major works of the viola repertoire citation needed paul hindemith who was a violist wrote a substantial amount of music for viola including the concerto der schwanendreher
Instruments	Double bass	The double bass, also known simply as the bass (or by other names), is the largest and lowest-pitched bowed (or plucked) string instrument[1] in the modern symphony orchestra. The bass is a standard member of the orchestra's string section,[2] as well as the concert band, and is featured in concertos, solo, and chamber music in Western classical music.[3] The bass is used in a range of other genres, such as jazz, 1950s-style blues and rock and roll, rockabilly, psychobilly, traditional country music, bluegrass, tango and many types of folk music. The bass is a transposing instrument and is typically notated one octave higher than tuned to avoid excessive ledger lines below the staff. The double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths[4] (like a viol), rather than fifths, with strings usually tuned to E1, A1, D2 and G2. The instrument's exact lineage is still a matter of some debate, with scholars divided on whether the bass is derived from the viol or the violin family. The double bass is played with a bow (arco), or by plucking the strings (pizzicato), or via a variety of extended techniques. In orchestral repertoire and tango music, both arco and pizzicato are employed. In jazz, blues, and rockabilly, pizzicato is the norm. Classical music uses the natural sound produced acoustically by the instrument, as does traditional bluegrass. In jazz, blues, reggae, and related genres, the bass is frequently amplified.	the double bass also known simply as the bass or by other names is the largest and lowest pitched bowed or plucked string instrument in the modern symphony orchestra the bass is a standard member of the orchestra s string section as well as the concert band and is featured in concertos solo and chamber music in western classical music the bass is used in a range of other genres such as jazz style blues and rock and roll rockabilly psychobilly traditional country music bluegrass tango and many types of folk music the bass is a transposing instrument and is typically notated one octave higher than tuned to avoid excessive ledger lines below the staff the double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths like a viol rather than fifths with strings usually tuned to and the instrument s exact lineage is still a matter of some debate with scholars divided on whether the bass is derived from the viol or the violin family the double bass is played with a bow arco or by plucking the strings pizzicato or via a variety of extended techniques in orchestral repertoire and tango music both arco and pizzicato are employed in jazz blues and rockabilly pizzicato is the norm classical music uses the natural sound produced acoustically by the instrument as does traditional bluegrass in jazz blues reggae and related genres the bass is frequently amplified
